## Corrector Drugs

Corrector drugs are a class of therapeutic agents that help proteins achieve their correct three-dimensional structure, enabling them to function more effectively. These drugs are particularly important for treating certain genetic disorders caused by mutations that result in misfolded proteins. Below are a few examples of conditions where corrector drugs are either in use or under development.

### Cystic Fibrosis

In the case of cystic fibrosis, misfolded CFTR (Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane conductance Regulator) proteins, resulting from genetic mutations, are unable to regulate chloride ions across cell membranes effectively. Corrector drugs like elexacaftor and tezacaftor, components of TRIKAFTA, bind to the misfolded CFTR protein, helping it to adopt the correct conformation and function more effectively.

### Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency

Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency (AAT deficiency) is a genetic disorder that can lead to lung and liver disease. The deficiency is caused by mutations in the SERPINA1 gene, leading to misfolded alpha-1 antitrypsin proteins that cannot escape from the liver cells where they are made. Corrector drugs such as lumacaftor and VX-864 are being developed to assist these proteins in achieving their correct configuration, preventing them from accumulating in the liver.

### Lysosomal Storage Disorders

Lysosomal storage disorders encompass a group of inherited diseases characterized by a buildup of toxic materials within cells due to misfolded proteins. Corrector drugs like miglustat, VTS-270, and ambroxol are being developed to help the proteins associated with these disorders function properly, thereby reducing the toxic buildup within cells.

### Epilepsy

Certain forms of epilepsy are linked to mutations in potassium channels. These mutations may cause the proteins to be misfolded, impeding their normal functioning. Corrector drugs, such as 4-phenylbutyrate, are being developed to improve the trafficking of these channels to the cell surface, enhancing their functionality and thereby managing the symptoms of the disease.

### Respiratory Syncytial Virus

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a significant cause of respiratory infections in infants and young children. Some corrector drugs, like ALN-RSV01, are being developed to target the folding and trafficking of the viral fusion protein, a key protein the virus uses to infect cells. These correctors could potentially improve the immune system's ability to combat the virus.

It's crucial to note that while corrector drugs improve the functionality of misfolded proteins, they do not cure the underlying genetic mutations causing these diseases. Also, the effectiveness and safety of these drugs are subject to ongoing clinical trials and regulatory approvals.



# Chaperone Drugs

Chaperone drugs, also known as pharmacological chaperones, are a type of medication that interact with and stabilize misfolded proteins, allowing them to regain their normal function. These drugs are particularly useful in the treatment of diseases caused by protein misfolding, such as cystic fibrosis, Gaucher disease, and certain forms of cancer.

## Mechanism of Action

Chaperone drugs work by binding to the unstable, misfolded proteins, stabilizing them and helping them to fold correctly. This can restore the protein's normal function and reduce the symptoms of the disease.

## Applications

Chaperone drugs have been used in the treatment of a variety of diseases, including:

- Cystic fibrosis: Chaperone drugs can help correct the misfolded CFTR protein that causes this disease.
- Gaucher disease: Chaperone drugs can stabilize the misfolded glucocerebrosidase enzyme in this disease.
- Certain forms of cancer: Some cancers are caused by misfolded proteins that lead to uncontrolled cell growth. Chaperone drugs can help correct these proteins and slow the growth of the cancer.
