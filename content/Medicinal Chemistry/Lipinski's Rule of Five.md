# Lipinski's Rule of 5

Lipinski's Rule of 5, also known as the Pfizer's Rule of 5, is a rule of thumb in medicinal chemistry for evaluating druglikeness or determining if a chemical compound with a certain pharmacological or biological activity has properties that would make it a likely orally active drug in humans.

## Overview

The rule was formulated by Christopher A. Lipinski in 1997, based on the observation that most medication drugs are relatively small and moderately lipophilic molecules.

## The Rules

The rule describes molecular properties important for a drug's pharmacokinetics in the human body, including their absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion ("ADME"). The rule states that, in general, an orally active drug has no more than one violation of the following criteria:

1. No more than 5 hydrogen bond donors (nitrogen or oxygen atoms with one or more hydrogen atoms)
2. No more than 10 hydrogen bond acceptors (nitrogen or oxygen atoms)
3. A molecular mass less than 500 daltons
4. An octanol-water partition coefficient log P not greater than 5

## Exceptions

While the rule is quite useful in drug discovery, there are a number of exceptions. For example, many drugs are substrates of biological transporters thus violating rule 4. Also, many macrocyclic drugs violate rule 3.
