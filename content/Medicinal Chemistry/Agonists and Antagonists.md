## Agonists
In pharmacology, an **agonist** is a drug or a substance which initiates a physiological response
when combined with a receptor. They work by binding to specific receptors in the body and mimicking
the effects of naturally occurring substances.
Agonists can be classified into two types:
1. **Full Agonists**: These drugs bind and activate a receptor, displaying full efficacy at that
receptor. They have the ability to activate the receptor and result in a maximal biological
response. Example: Morphine.
2. **Partial Agonists**: These drugs also bind and activate a receptor, but are only capable of
providing a partial maximal response, even when the receptor is fully saturated. Example:
Buprenorphine.
## Antagonists
An **antagonist** is a type of drug that blocks or dampens a biological response by binding to and
blocking a receptor rather than activating it like an agonist. They are sometimes called blockers;
examples include alpha blockers, beta blockers, and calcium channel blockers.
Antagonists can be classified into two main types:
1. **Competitive Antagonists**: These drugs compete with agonists for the same receptor sites,
resulting in a diminished biological response. They can be overcome by increasing the concentration
of the agonist. Example: Naloxone.
2. **Non-Competitive Antagonists**: These drugs bind either to the same receptor as the agonist
but in a different site (allosteric site) or to a separate receptor that controls the agonist's
receptor in a non-competitive way, resulting in the blocking of the agonist's effect. Example:
Ketamine.
In drug therapy, the use of agonists and antagonists can help to increase or decrease the activity
of the body's natural chemicals, helping to prevent, treat, or manage various health conditions.
