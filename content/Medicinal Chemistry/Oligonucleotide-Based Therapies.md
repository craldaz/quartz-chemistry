# Oligonucleotide-Based Therapies

Oligonucleotide-based therapies are a class of drugs that use short DNA or RNA molecules to regulate the expression of genes. These therapies have the potential to treat a wide range of diseases, including genetic disorders, cancers, and infectious diseases.

## Overview

Oligonucleotides are short DNA or RNA molecules that can bind to specific sequences of RNA or DNA in cells. By doing so, they can interfere with the function of genes, either by blocking the production of proteins, altering protein production, or triggering the destruction of the target RNA.

## Key Concepts

### Antisense Oligonucleotides

Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) are designed to bind to the messenger RNA (mRNA) produced by a specific gene. By binding to the mRNA, the ASO can block the production of the protein encoded by the gene. This can be useful in treating diseases caused by the overproduction of a specific protein.

### Small Interfering RNA

Small interfering RNA (siRNA) is a type of oligonucleotide that can trigger the destruction of specific mRNA molecules in the cell. This can effectively "silence" the gene that produces the mRNA, preventing the production of the corresponding protein.

### Aptamers

Aptamers are oligonucleotides that can bind to specific proteins or other molecules in the body. They can be used to interfere with the function of these molecules, potentially treating diseases caused by their activity.

## Applications

Oligonucleotide-based therapies have been used to treat a variety of diseases. For example, the drug nusinersen is an ASO that is used to treat spinal muscular atrophy, a genetic disorder that causes muscle weakness and atrophy. Other oligonucleotide drugs are being developed to treat diseases such as cancer, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and various infectious diseases.
