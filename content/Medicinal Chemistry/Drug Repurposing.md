Drug repurposing, also known as drug repositioning, is a strategy for identifying new uses for approved or investigational drugs that are outside the scope of the original medical indication. 

The process involves the application of known drugs and compounds to treat new diseases. This strategy can save time and money as these drugs have already passed a significant number of safety and efficacy tests. 

For example, a drug that was originally developed for treating one type of cancer might be repurposed to treat a different type of cancer or even a completely different disease, like a neurological disorder. 

Drug repurposing has become an increasingly popular strategy because it can significantly reduce the cost and time needed to bring a drug to market, as compared to the traditional drug development process.
