# Drug Discovery

Drug discovery is the process by which new candidate medications are discovered. This involves a wide range of scientific disciplines, including biology, chemistry, pharmacology, and computational science.

## Overview

The process of drug discovery involves the identification of candidates, synthesis, characterization, screening, and assays for therapeutic efficacy. Once a compound has shown its value in these tests, it will begin the process of drug development prior to clinical trials.

## Stages of Drug Discovery

1. **Target Identification**: The first step in the drug discovery process is to understand the disease that needs to be treated and identify a 'target' that can be affected to treat the disease. This could be a protein or gene that is involved in the disease.

2. **Hit Discovery**: The next step is to find a molecule or 'hit' that can affect the target identified in the previous step. This can be done through high-throughput screening, where large libraries of chemicals are tested for their ability to affect the target, or through rational drug design, where knowledge of the target structure is used to design molecules.

3. **Lead Optimization**: Once a hit has been identified, it needs to be optimized to make it more drug-like. This can involve improving its potency, selectivity, and pharmacokinetic properties.

4. **Preclinical Testing**: Before a drug can be tested in humans, it needs to undergo preclinical testing in the lab and in animals to evaluate its safety and efficacy.

## Modern Drug Discovery

Modern drug discovery involves the use of high-throughput screening techniques and in silico (computer-aided) drug design to rapidly test and design new drugs. This has significantly sped up the drug discovery process and reduced the cost of developing new drugs.
