# Antipsychotics

**Antipsychotics**, also known as neuroleptics, are a class of medication primarily used to manage psychosis, including delusions, hallucinations, paranoia, or disordered thought, principally in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. They are increasingly being used in the management of non-psychotic disorders.

## Overview

Antipsychotics are usually effective in relieving symptoms of psychosis in the short term. The long-term use of antipsychotics is associated with side effects such as involuntary movement disorders, gynecomastia, and metabolic syndrome. They are also associated with increased mortality in elderly people with dementia.

## Types of Antipsychotics

Antipsychotics are broadly categorized into two groups: typical antipsychotics and atypical antipsychotics.

1. **Typical Antipsychotics**: Also known as first-generation antipsychotics, these were the first antipsychotics developed. They include drugs such as haloperidol, chlorpromazine, and fluphenazine. Typical antipsychotics are primarily dopamine antagonists.

2. **Atypical Antipsychotics**: Also known as second-generation antipsychotics, these are a more recent development. They include drugs such as clozapine, risperidone, olanzapine, and quetiapine. Atypical antipsychotics are not only dopamine antagonists but also serotonin antagonists.

## Mechanism of Action

Antipsychotics work by changing the effects of chemicals in the brain, primarily dopamine, a neurotransmitter that is believed to be involved in psychosis. Most antipsychotics are dopamine antagonists, meaning they work by blocking the dopamine receptors in the brain. This helps to normalize the dopamine function in the brain, reducing or relieving psychotic symptoms.

## Side Effects

Antipsychotics can have side effects, some of which can be serious. These can include drowsiness, dizziness, restlessness, weight gain, tremors, dry mouth, constipation, and high cholesterol. Some people may also have an increased risk of diabetes, low white blood cell count, and movement disorders like tardive dyskinesia.
