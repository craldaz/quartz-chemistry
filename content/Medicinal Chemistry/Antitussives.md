# Antitussives

## Overview

Antitussives are a type of medication used to suppress or relieve coughing. They are often used in the treatment of coughs caused by the common cold, flu, or other respiratory conditions.

## Dextromethorphan

Dextromethorphan (DXM or DM) is a common antitussive drug found in many over-the-counter cold and cough medicines. It works by affecting the signals in the brain that trigger the cough reflex.

### Mechanism of Action

Dextromethorphan acts on the cough center in the medulla oblongata, where it suppresses the urge to cough. It is also an NMDA receptor antagonist and sigma-1 receptor agonist, which may contribute to its efficacy.

### Side Effects

Common side effects of dextromethorphan include dizziness, lightheadedness, drowsiness, nausea, and vomiting. In rare cases, it can cause serious side effects such as severe dizziness, anxiety, restless feeling, hallucinations, slow or shallow breathing.

### Precautions

Dextromethorphan should not be used in patients who are currently taking or have recently taken monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). It should also be used with caution in patients with a history of substance abuse due to its potential for misuse and addiction.
