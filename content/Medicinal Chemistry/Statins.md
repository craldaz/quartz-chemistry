## Statins

**Statins**, also known as HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, are a class of lipid-lowering medications that inhibit the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase, which plays a central role in the production of cholesterol in the liver. High levels of cholesterol have been associated with cardiovascular disease.

Statins are primarily used for lowering LDL (Low-Density Lipoprotein) cholesterol, also known as "bad cholesterol," which is associated with increased risk of heart disease and stroke. They can also modestly increase HDL (High-Density Lipoprotein) cholesterol, known as "good cholesterol," and decrease total cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations.

In addition to their lipid-lowering effects, statins also have anti-inflammatory properties, which may help stabilize the lining of the blood vessels, making plaques less likely to rupture and cause a heart attack.

Commonly prescribed statins include atorvastatin (Lipitor), fluvastatin (Lescol), lovastatin (Altoprev), pitavastatin (Livalo), pravastatin (Pravachol), rosuvastatin (Crestor), and simvastatin (Zocor). 

Potential side effects of statins include muscle pain, increased blood sugar levels, and neurological side effects like memory loss or confusion. The benefits of statin therapy for most people outweigh the potential risks.
