# Baeyer-Villiger Reaction

The Baeyer-Villiger Reaction is an organic reaction that involves the oxidation of ketones to esters by using peroxyacids or peroxides as the oxidizing agent. Named after Adolf von Baeyer and Victor Villiger who first reported the reaction in 1899, it is a reliable method for the insertion of an oxygen atom adjacent to a carbonyl group.

## Overview

In the Baeyer-Villiger Reaction, a ketone is converted into an ester when treated with a peroxyacid. The reaction proceeds via a cyclic transition state, leading to a rearrangement of the carbonyl group and an alkyl (or aryl) group. The migration tendency of the groups determines the major product.

## Mechanism

The mechanism of the Baeyer-Villiger Reaction involves three main steps:

1. **Formation of the Criegee Intermediate**: The peroxyacid reacts with the ketone to form a tetrahedral Criegee intermediate. This is an addition reaction, where the carbonyl oxygen attacks the electrophilic peracid oxygen.

2. **Migration Step**: The alkyl (or aryl) group migrates to the peroxide oxygen, leading to a rearrangement of the Criegee intermediate. The group with the higher migratory aptitude migrates preferentially.

3. **Product Formation**: The rearranged Criegee intermediate breaks down to form the ester product and a carboxylic acid.

## Applications

The Baeyer-Villiger Reaction is widely used in organic synthesis for the preparation of esters and lactones. It is also used in the synthesis of pharmaceuticals and complex natural products.

## Limitations

While the Baeyer-Villiger Reaction is a powerful tool for the oxidation of ketones, it has some limitations. The reaction requires the use of hazardous peroxides, and the selectivity can be an issue when the ketone has two different alkyl groups.
