title: Welcome to Quartz Chemistry

Dive into the fascinating world of chemistry with Quartz Chemistry, your interactive guide to the universe of chemical science. Our platform is designed to help students, educators, researchers, and chemistry enthusiasts explore a wide array of chemistry topics in a unique and engaging way. The notes can also be downloaded, modified locally in Obsidian, and reuploaded with Quartz in your own applications. 

Quartz Chemistry is not just another online chemistry resource. It's a dynamic, interconnected map of chemistry topics, akin to a Wikipedia but with a twist. Each topic is a node in a vast network, linked to related topics, creating an intricate web of knowledge that you can navigate at your own pace.

The **Local Graph View** offers a focused perspective, showing you the direct connections of a selected topic. It displays all the related topics that are just one hop away, providing a concise overview of the immediate context of your chosen subject. You can click on a node in the graph to navigate to that note. 

For a broader perspective, switch to the **Global Graph View**. This comprehensive map displays all the topics in our database and their interconnections. It's a bird's eye view of the vast landscape of chemistry, perfect for exploring new topics or understanding the bigger picture. The global graph view can be toggled by clicking the graph icon on the top-right of the local graph view. It shows all the notes in your graph and how they connect to each other.

The Backlinks section shows all notes that are linked to the note you are looking at, and the Explorer section shows you how the notes are organized into folders.
