# Electronegativity

Electronegativity is a measure of the tendency of an atom to attract a bonding pair of electrons. The term was first proposed by Linus Pauling in 1932. It is one of the most important concepts in the study of chemical bonding.

## Overview

In a chemical bond, if the electrons are shared equally between the atoms then the bond is said to be covalent. If one atom attracts the electrons in the bond more than the other, the bond is polar, with the electron density being greater around the more electronegative atom.

## Measurement

Electronegativity is usually measured on the Pauling scale, named after Linus Pauling who first proposed it. This is a dimensionless scale ranging from around 0.7 (for francium) to 4.0 (for fluorine). Other scales, such as the Mulliken scale or the Allred-Rochow scale, are also used.

## Trends in the Periodic Table

Electronegativity increases from left to right across a period in the periodic table. This is because the number of charges on the nucleus increases, attracting the bonding pair of electrons more strongly.

Electronegativity decreases down a group in the periodic table. This is because the additional electron shells shield the bonding pair of electrons from the attraction of the nucleus.

## Applications

Electronegativity is used to predict whether a bond between atoms will be ionic or covalent. It can also be used to predict the polarity of a chemical bond. In general, the greater the difference in electronegativity between the atoms in a bond, the more polar the bond.
