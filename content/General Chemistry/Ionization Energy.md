# Ionization Energy (Ionization Potential)

Ionization energy, also known as ionization potential, is the energy required to remove an electron from a gaseous atom or ion.

## Overview

The closer and more tightly bound an electron is to the nucleus, the more difficult it will be to remove, and the higher its ionization energy will be. Ionization energy is expressed in units of energy, typically electron volts (eV), but sometimes in kilojoules per mole (kJ/mol) or other units.

## First, Second, and Subsequent Ionization Energies

The energy required to remove the first electron is called the first ionization energy, the energy to remove the second electron is called the second ionization energy, and so on. Each subsequent ionization energy is greater than the last, because the positive charge of the nucleus increases as electrons are removed, attracting the remaining electrons more strongly.

## Periodic Trends

In the periodic table, ionization energy generally increases from left to right across a period (due to increasing nuclear charge) and decreases from top to bottom down a group (due to increasing atomic radius).

## Applications

Ionization energy is a crucial concept in fields such as chemistry, physics, and materials science. It plays a key role in processes such as chemical bonding, electrical conductivity, and the operation of solar cells.
