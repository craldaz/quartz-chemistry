# Dipole Moment (Chemistry)

In **chemistry**, a **dipole moment** is a measure of the polarity of a molecule. It's a mathematical product of the charge on atoms and the distance between them. The presence of a dipole moment is a direct indication of charge separation within a molecule, which in turn indicates the degree of polarity in the chemical bond or the entire molecule. 

Dipole moments are important in understanding the shapes of molecules, their reactivity, and how they interact with electric fields. They're typically measured in Debye units (D), and vector quantities, having both a magnitude and direction.

## Factors Affecting Dipole Moment
Dipole moments can be affected by several factors:

1. **Electronegativity**: The more electronegative an atom, the more likely it is to attract the shared pair of electrons in a bond, leading to a higher dipole moment.
2. **Molecular Structure**: In complex molecules, individual bond dipoles can cancel each other out if they're symmetrically arranged, leading to a net dipole moment of zero.
