# London Dispersion Force

London dispersion forces (LDF), also known as dispersion forces or London forces, are weak intermolecular forces that arise from the interactions between instantaneous multipoles in atoms or molecules.

## Overview

London dispersion forces are named after the German-American physicist Fritz London. They are a type of van der Waals force and are present between all atoms and molecules, regardless of their polarity. 

These forces are caused by the instantaneous polarization of an electron cloud around an atom or molecule, which induces a similar polarization in nearby atoms or molecules. This results in a temporary attractive force between them.

## Strength of London Dispersion Forces

The strength of London dispersion forces depends on the polarizability of the atom or molecule, which in turn depends on the number of electrons and the size of the electron cloud. Larger and heavier atoms and molecules have stronger London dispersion forces.

## Role in Physical Properties

London dispersion forces play a significant role in determining the physical properties of substances, such as their boiling and melting points, viscosity, and surface tension. They are also crucial for the stability of nonpolar molecules and the solubility of nonpolar substances in nonpolar solvents.
