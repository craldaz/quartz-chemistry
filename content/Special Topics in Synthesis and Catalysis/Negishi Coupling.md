## Negishi Coupling

The **Negishi Coupling** is a powerful chemical reaction used in organic chemistry for the synthesis of complex organic compounds. It is named after its discoverer, Ei-ichi Negishi, who shared the 2010 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for this and related palladium-catalyzed cross coupling reactions.

The Negishi Coupling reaction involves the cross-coupling of an organozinc compound (R-Zn-X) with an organic halide (R'-X) in the presence of a palladium catalyst to form a new carbon-carbon bond. The general reaction scheme is as follows:

`R-Zn-X + R'-X --> R-R' + ZnX2`

This reaction is used for the formation of biaryl compounds and other systems with conjugated double bonds. It's notable for its ability to form complex molecules with excellent control over stereoselectivity and regioselectivity.

Organic halides used in the reaction can be primary, secondary, or tertiary, and can be activated by a variety of functional groups. The reaction works with a variety of organozinc reagents, including alkyl-, aryl-, and alkenyl-zinc compounds.

Advantages of the Negishi coupling over other types of cross-coupling reactions include the mild reaction conditions, high tolerance for various functional groups, and the availability of organozinc reagents. However, it requires the preparation of organozinc reagents, which may be air-sensitive and require careful handling.
