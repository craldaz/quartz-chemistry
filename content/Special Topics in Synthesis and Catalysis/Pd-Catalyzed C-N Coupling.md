# Pd-Catalyzed C-N Coupling

Pd-Catalyzed C-N Coupling, also known as the Buchwald-Hartwig amination, is a chemical reaction that involves the palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling of aryl halides with amines. This reaction is a powerful method for the formation of C-N bonds, which are key structural elements in many pharmaceuticals, natural products, and materials.

## History

The reaction is named after the American chemists John F. Hartwig and Stephen L. Buchwald. They independently developed the reaction during the 1990s, and their work has significantly advanced the field of cross-coupling reactions.

## Reaction Mechanism

The Buchwald-Hartwig amination involves the use of a palladium catalyst to facilitate the coupling of an aryl halide and an amine to form a new C-N bond. The reaction proceeds through the following steps:

1. Oxidative addition of the aryl halide to the palladium(0) catalyst to form a palladium(II) complex.
2. Coordination of the amine to the palladium(II) complex.
3. Reductive elimination to form the C-N bond and regenerate the palladium(0) catalyst.

## Applications

The Buchwald-Hartwig amination has found wide application in the synthesis of pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and materials due to its ability to form C-N bonds under mild conditions and with a wide range of substrates. It is particularly useful for the synthesis of aryl amines, which are common structural motifs in these compounds.
