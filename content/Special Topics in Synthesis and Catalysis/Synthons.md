# Synthons in Retrosynthesis

Synthons are idealized fragments used in retrosynthetic analysis, a problem-solving technique used to transform the structure of a synthetic target molecule to a sequence of progressively simpler structures along a pathway which ultimately leads to simple or commercially available starting materials for a chemical synthesis.

## Overview

The term "synthon" was introduced by E.J. Corey, a Nobel laureate, and is used to describe structural units within a molecule which can be built up from smaller molecules. In retrosynthetic analysis, the target molecule is broken down into its constituent synthons, which represent a simplified form of the molecule.

## Role in Retrosynthesis

Retrosynthesis is essentially a process of deconstruction, where the target molecule is broken down into simpler molecule or molecules using known reactions and intermediates. This process is repeated until simple or commercially available precursors are reached.

Synthons play a crucial role in this process. They are the theoretical counterparts of synthetic building blocks, and are used as a way of simplifying complex structures and visualizing a synthetic route to a target molecule.

## Examples

For example, a carboxylic acid could be considered as being derived from the synthon, which is an anionic synthon, and a proton synthon. In practice, of course, these synthons do not exist per se; they are merely formalized ways of viewing a retrosynthetic step.

## Limitations

While synthons are a useful tool in retrosynthetic analysis, they are not without limitations. They are theoretical constructs and do not always correspond to actual chemical species. Therefore, the transformation of synthons into actual synthetic building blocks often requires additional steps or modifications.
