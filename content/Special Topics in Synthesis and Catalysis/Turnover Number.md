# Turnover Number (TON) in Catalysis

Turnover number (TON) is a key concept in the field of catalysis. It is a measure of the catalytic activity or efficiency of a catalyst in a chemical reaction.

## Definition

The turnover number is defined as the maximum number of moles of product that can be generated per mole of catalyst when the catalyst is fully utilized. It is a measure of the total catalytic activity of a given amount of catalyst.

## Calculation

The TON is calculated by dividing the number of moles of product formed by the number of moles of catalyst used. It is typically reported as a dimensionless number.

## Significance

The TON is a critical parameter in assessing the efficiency of a catalyst. A high TON indicates that a small amount of catalyst can facilitate the conversion of a large amount of reactant into product, which is desirable in both laboratory and industrial settings.

The TON can also provide insight into the mechanism of a catalytic reaction. For example, a low TON may suggest that the catalyst is being deactivated over the course of the reaction.
