# `Title:` [[Robinson Annulation]]

Robinson Annulation is an interesting way to synthesize a 6 membered alpha,beta unsaturated ketones, it has applications in the synthesis of natural products such as steroids

The mechanism starts with the michael addition of two ketons to form a 1,5 diketone

The 1,5 diketone can further react via intramolecular cyclization.

The problem with this synthesis is that deprotonating an alpha hydrogen from a ketone or aldehyde requires a very strong base. 


This might be an interesting reaction to put in the library of templates because we don't necessarily want all the crap that will be formed if we allow those reactions (e.g. 1,5 diketones).
