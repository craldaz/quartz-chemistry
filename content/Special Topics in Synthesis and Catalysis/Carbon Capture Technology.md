## Carbon Capture Technologies in Chemistry

Carbon Capture Technologies refer to a variety of techniques used to capture and store [carbon dioxide (CO2)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_dioxide) to prevent it from being released into the atmosphere. 

### Overview

Carbon capture technologies are crucial in the fight against climate change, as they can help to reduce the amount of CO2 released into the atmosphere from industrial processes and fossil fuel combustion. These technologies can also transform captured CO2 into useful chemicals through catalysis.

### Metal Organic Frameworks (MOFs)

[Metal Organic Frameworks (MOFs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal%E2%80%93organic_framework) are one of the most promising materials for carbon capture. MOFs are porous materials that can selectively adsorb CO2 from a mixture of gases. The high surface area and tunable pore size of MOFs make them ideal for capturing and storing large amounts of CO2.

### Catalysis for CO2 Transformation

Catalysis plays a crucial role in transforming captured CO2 into useful chemicals. Various catalysts can facilitate the conversion of CO2 into products such as methanol, formic acid, and even hydrocarbons. This not only helps to reduce CO2 emissions but also provides a sustainable route to valuable chemical feedstocks.
