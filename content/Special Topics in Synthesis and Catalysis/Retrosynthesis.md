# Retrosynthetic Analysis

Retrosynthetic analysis is a technique used in the field of organic chemistry to solve complex or difficult synthetic problems. The concept was introduced by E.J. Corey in 1967 and has since been widely adopted in the synthetic community.

## Overview

Retrosynthetic analysis involves breaking down complex molecules into simpler ones, or precursors, through a process that is the reverse of chemical synthesis. The goal is to simplify the synthesis of a target molecule by identifying simpler precursor molecules from which it can be synthesized.

The process involves the use of various strategies and tactics, including functional group interconversions, ring transformations, and the use of protecting groups. The ultimate goal is to identify a series of simple, commercially available starting materials that can be used to synthesize the target molecule.

## Applications

Retrosynthetic analysis is a fundamental method used in organic chemistry for the planning of organic syntheses. It is used in the design of synthetic routes for the production of drugs, polymers, and other organic compounds.
