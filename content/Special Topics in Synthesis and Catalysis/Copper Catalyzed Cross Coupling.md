# Copper-Catalyzed Cross-Coupling Reactions

Copper-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions are a class of reactions where a copper catalyst facilitates the coupling of two organic substrates. These reactions are a powerful tool in organic synthesis, allowing for the formation of carbon-carbon (C-C) and carbon-heteroatom (C-X) bonds. They are related to, but distinct from, the more commonly known palladium- and nickel-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions.

## Mechanism

The general mechanism for copper-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions involves three main steps:

1. **Oxidative Addition**: The copper catalyst (usually in the Cu(I) oxidation state) undergoes oxidative addition with one of the organic substrates, forming a copper complex in a higher oxidation state (usually Cu(III)).

2. **Transmetalation**: The second organic substrate undergoes transmetalation with the copper complex, replacing one of the ligands.

3. **Reductive Elimination**: The copper complex undergoes reductive elimination, forming a new bond between the two organic substrates and returning the copper catalyst to its original oxidation state.

## Mechanism
Concerted oxidative addiiton of Copper 2 to Copper 3 (ish)
oxidative addition is enabled by ligand "non-innoscence"


## Applications

Copper-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions have found wide application in the synthesis of complex organic molecules, including pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and materials. They are particularly useful for the formation of C-C and C-X bonds, which are common structural motifs in these compounds.

Copper catalysts are often cheaper and more abundant than palladium and nickel catalysts, making copper-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions an attractive option for large-scale industrial processes.
