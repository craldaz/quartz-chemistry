# Ni-Catalyzed Amination

Ni-Catalyzed Amination is a chemical reaction that involves the nickel-catalyzed cross-coupling of aryl halides with amines. This reaction is a powerful method for the formation of C-N bonds, which are key structural elements in many pharmaceuticals, natural products, and materials.

## Reaction Mechanism

The mechanism of Ni-catalyzed amination is still a subject of ongoing research. However, two main catalytic cycles have been proposed: the Ni(0) mechanism and the Ni(I) to Ni(III) cycle.

### Ni(0) Mechanism

In the Ni(0) mechanism, the reaction begins with the oxidative addition of the aryl halide to a Ni(0) complex to form a Ni(II) complex. The amine then coordinates to the Ni(II) complex, followed by reductive elimination to form the C-N bond and regenerate the Ni(0) complex.

### Ni(I) to Ni(III) Cycle

In the Ni(I) to Ni(III) cycle, the reaction begins with the oxidative addition of the aryl halide to a Ni(I) complex to form a Ni(III) complex. The amine then coordinates to the Ni(III) complex, followed by reductive elimination to form the C-N bond and regenerate the Ni(I) complex.

## John Hartwig 
He says the rate-determining step is the Ni0 ArX addition, it can occur via a radical or non-radical pathway. 

He showed results that depending on the electron richness of the nickel catalysts and electron poor aryl halides favor SET

While less rich catalysts and electron rich aryl halides favored concerted addition (non-radical)

## Applications

Ni-catalyzed amination has found wide application in the synthesis of pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and materials due to its ability to form C-N bonds under mild conditions and with a wide range of substrates. It is particularly useful for the synthesis of aryl amines, which are common structural motifs in these compounds.
