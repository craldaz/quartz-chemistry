# Chemical Engineering

Chemical engineering is a branch of engineering that applies physical sciences (physics and chemistry), life sciences (microbiology and biochemistry), together with applied mathematics and economics to produce, transform, transport, and properly use chemicals, materials and energy.

## Overview

Chemical engineers design large-scale processes that convert chemicals, raw materials, living cells, microorganisms, and energy into useful forms and products. They are involved in many aspects of plant design and operation, including safety and hazard assessments, process design and analysis, modeling, control engineering, chemical reaction engineering, nuclear engineering, biological engineering, construction specification, and operating instructions.

## Fields of Study

Chemical engineering encompasses a wide range of fields and may be divided into two broad categories: traditional chemical engineering and modern chemical engineering. 

Traditional chemical engineering involves the design and maintenance of chemical processes for large-scale manufacturing. This includes areas such as petrochemicals, materials science, and pharmaceuticals.

Modern chemical engineering, on the other hand, focuses on technological advancements in fields such as nanotechnology, bioengineering, and environmental engineering. 

## Practice

In practice, chemical engineers work in a variety of industries, including energy, food and drink, water treatment, plastics, toiletries, pharmaceuticals, and many more. They are involved in designing and operating processing plants, researching new products and methods, improving existing processes, and managing resources and environmental impacts.
