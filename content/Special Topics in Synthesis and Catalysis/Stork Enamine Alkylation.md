The **Stork enamine alkylation** involves the addition of an [enamine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enamine "Enamine") to a [Michael acceptor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_acceptor "Michael acceptor") (e.g, an [Î±,Î² -unsaturated carbonyl compound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enone "Enone")) or another electrophilic alkylation reagent to give an alkylated [iminium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iminium "Iminium") product, which is hydrolyzed by dilute aqueous acid to give the alkylated ketone or aldehyde
