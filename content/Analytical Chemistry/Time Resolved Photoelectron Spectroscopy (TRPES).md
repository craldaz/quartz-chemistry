## Time-Resolved Photoelectron Spectroscopy (TRPES)

Time-Resolved Photoelectron Spectroscopy (TRPES) is a technique used to study the dynamics of electronic and structural changes in molecules. It combines the principles of photoelectron spectroscopy and ultrafast laser spectroscopy.

### Process of TRPES

1. **Excitation**: A sample is excited by an ultrafast laser pulse, which promotes electrons to higher energy states.

2. **Ionization**: After a delay time, a second laser pulse ionizes the excited molecules, ejecting photoelectrons.

3. **Detection**: The kinetic energy and angular distribution of the photoelectrons are measured, providing information about the electronic and structural dynamics of the molecules.

### Applications of TRPES

TRPES is used in various fields such as:

- **Chemical Physics**: For studying the dynamics of chemical reactions, including bond breaking and bond formation processes.

- **Physical Chemistry**: For studying the dynamics of charge transfer processes in molecules.

- **Materials Science**: For studying the dynamics of electronic processes in materials, such as charge carrier generation and recombination in semiconductors.
