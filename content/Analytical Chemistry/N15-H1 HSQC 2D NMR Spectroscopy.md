# N15-H1 HSQC 2D NMR Spectroscopy

N15-H1 HSQC (Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence) 2D NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) spectroscopy is a powerful analytical technique used in the study of molecular structures and dynamics. It is particularly useful in the field of protein NMR.

## Overview

HSQC is a two-dimensional NMR experiment that correlates the chemical shifts of directly bonded pairs of nuclei that are spin-1/2, typically a proton (H1) and a heteronucleus (N15). The resulting spectrum provides a 'fingerprint' of the molecule under investigation, with each peak corresponding to a unique H-N pair.

## Application

N15-H1 HSQC is commonly used in protein NMR to obtain sequence-specific assignments. By labeling the protein with N15, each amide proton (H) and its directly bonded nitrogen (N) can be correlated in the HSQC spectrum. This allows for the identification of individual amino acids in the protein sequence.

## Procedure

The N15-H1 HSQC experiment involves several steps:

1. **Preparation**: The sample is prepared with N15-labeled proteins dissolved in a suitable deuterated solvent.

2. **Excitation**: The sample is placed in a strong magnetic field and irradiated with a sequence of radiofrequency pulses.

3. **Detection**: The resulting NMR signal is detected and processed to produce a 2D spectrum, with one axis representing the proton chemical shifts and the other representing the nitrogen chemical shifts.
