# Fluorescence Spectroscopy

Fluorescence spectroscopy, also known as fluorometry or spectrofluorometry, is a type of electromagnetic spectroscopy that analyzes fluorescence from a sample. 

## Overview

Fluorescence spectroscopy involves using a beam of light that excites the electrons in molecules of certain compounds and causes them to emit light. Typically, the emitted light has a longer wavelength, and therefore lower energy, than the absorbed radiation.

## Principle

The principle of fluorescence spectroscopy is based on the absorption of light by a sample, followed by the emission of light as the excited molecules return to their ground state. The emitted light, or fluorescence, is then measured and analyzed. The intensity of the emitted light is directly proportional to the concentration of the molecules, making fluorescence spectroscopy a quantitative technique.

## Applications

Fluorescence spectroscopy has a wide range of applications in various fields, including:

- **Biochemistry**: Fluorescence spectroscopy is used to study the structure and dynamics of biomolecules, such as proteins and nucleic acids.

- **Medical Diagnostics**: Fluorescence spectroscopy can be used to detect and diagnose various diseases, including cancer.

- **Environmental Science**: Fluorescence spectroscopy is used to detect and measure the concentration of pollutants in the environment.

- **Pharmaceuticals**: Fluorescence spectroscopy is used in drug discovery and development, and to measure drug concentrations in biological samples.
