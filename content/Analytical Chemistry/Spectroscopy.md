## Spectroscopy

Spectroscopy is the study of the interaction between matter and electromagnetic radiation as a function of the wavelength or frequency of the radiation. In simpler terms, spectroscopy is the precise study of color as generalized from visible light to all bands of the electromagnetic spectrum.

### Types of Spectroscopy

There are several different types of spectroscopy, each with its own specific uses and requirements. Some of the most common types include:

#### Ultraviolet-Visible (UV-Vis) Spectroscopy

UV-Vis spectroscopy measures the absorption of light in the ultraviolet and visible ranges. It is used to determine the concentration of a specific substance in a sample, based on how much light the sample absorbs.

#### Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy

IR spectroscopy measures the absorption of light in the infrared range. It is used to identify and study chemicals, as different chemicals will produce unique absorption spectra.

#### Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy

NMR spectroscopy uses the magnetic properties of certain atomic nuclei to provide information about the structure of molecules. It is widely used in organic chemistry and biochemistry.

#### Mass Spectrometry (MS)

Although not a type of spectroscopy in the traditional sense, MS is often included under the spectroscopy umbrella. It measures the mass-to-charge ratio of ions to identify and quantify molecules in a sample.

### Applications of Spectroscopy

Spectroscopy is used in physical and analytical chemistry for the identification of substances through the spectrum emitted from or absorbed by them. It is also used in astronomy to study the composition of stars and planets, in medicine and biology, in environmental applications, and in many other areas.
