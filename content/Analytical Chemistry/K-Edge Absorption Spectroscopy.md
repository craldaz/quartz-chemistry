## K-edge Absorption Spectroscopy

K-edge Absorption Spectroscopy is a type of X-ray absorption spectroscopy technique that is used to determine the electronic structure of a material. It involves the excitation of core electrons to unoccupied states in the conduction band.

### Process of K-edge Absorption Spectroscopy

1. **Excitation**: X-rays are used to excite core electrons (usually 1s electrons) in the sample. The energy of the X-rays is chosen to be near the binding energy of the core electrons.

2. **Absorption**: The core electrons absorb the X-ray energy and are excited to unoccupied states in the conduction band. This process creates an edge in the absorption spectrum, known as the K-edge.

3. **Detection**: The absorption of X-rays is measured as a function of energy. The shape and position of the K-edge provide information about the electronic structure of the material.

### Applications of K-edge Absorption Spectroscopy

K-edge Absorption Spectroscopy has a wide range of applications, particularly in the fields of materials science and chemistry. It can be used to study a variety of materials, including metals, semiconductors, insulators, and complex molecules. It provides information about the electronic structure of the material, including the density of states, the band structure, and the local atomic environment.
