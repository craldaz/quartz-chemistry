# Raman Spectroscopy

## Overview

Raman spectroscopy is a spectroscopic technique used to observe vibrational, rotational, and other low-frequency modes in a system. It relies on inelastic scattering, or Raman scattering, of monochromatic light, usually from a laser in the visible, near infrared, or near ultraviolet range.

## Principle

When light interacts with a molecule, it can cause the molecule to vibrate or rotate. Most of the light is scattered in an elastic manner, known as Rayleigh scattering. However, a small fraction of light (approximately 1 in 10 million photons) is scattered inelastically. This is known as Raman scattering. The energy difference between the incident photons and the Raman scattered photons corresponds to the energy of a vibrational mode of the molecule.

## Applications

Raman spectroscopy is used in chemistry to provide a structural fingerprint by which molecules can be identified. It is also used in solid state physics and materials science to characterize materials, measure temperature, and find the crystallographic orientation of a sample.

## Confocal Raman Microscopy

Confocal Raman microscopy is a technique that combines Raman spectroscopy with confocal microscopy. This allows for the collection of Raman spectra from very small volumes of a material, even down to the scale of individual cells in biological samples.

In confocal Raman microscopy, a laser is focused onto a small point in the sample. The Raman scattered light from this point is collected and passed through a pinhole, which rejects light from outside the focal point. This results in high spatial resolution and the ability to perform depth profiling or 3D imaging.

## History

Raman spectroscopy was named after the Indian scientist C. V. Raman, who discovered the Raman effect in 1928. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1930 for this discovery. Confocal Raman microscopy was developed later in the 20th century as a way to improve the spatial resolution of Raman spectroscopy.
