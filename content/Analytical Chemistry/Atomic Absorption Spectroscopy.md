## Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (AAS)

Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (AAS) is a spectroanalytical procedure for the quantitative determination of chemical elements using the absorption of optical radiation (light) by free atoms in the gaseous state.

### Process of AAS

1. **Atomization**: The sample is atomized, usually in a flame or graphite furnace, which converts the atoms of the element in the sample to gaseous atoms.

2. **Absorption**: A light beam with a wavelength that is specific to the same element is directed through the atom cloud. The atoms absorb some of the light.

3. **Detection**: The decrease in intensity of the light beam is measured by a detector, and the amount of light absorbed is used to calculate the concentration of the element in the sample.

### Types of AAS

There are several types of AAS, including:

- **Flame AAS**: The sample is atomized in a flame, which is less sensitive but simpler and cheaper.

- **Graphite Furnace AAS**: The sample is atomized in a graphite furnace, which is more sensitive but also more complex and expensive.

- **Cold Vapor AAS**: Used specifically for mercury, the sample is atomized in a quartz cell at room temperature.

### Applications of AAS

AAS is used in various fields such as:

- **Environmental Monitoring**: For analyzing the concentrations of metals in water, air, and soil samples.

- **Food and Beverage Analysis**: For determining the concentrations of metals in food and drink.

- **Clinical Analysis**: For determining the concentrations of metals in biological fluids such as blood and urine.

- **Pharmaceuticals**: For determining metal impurities in pharmaceutical products.
