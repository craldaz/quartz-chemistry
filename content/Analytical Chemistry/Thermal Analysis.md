## Thermal Analysis

Thermal Analysis refers to a group of techniques in which a physical property of a substance is measured as a function of temperature, while the substance is subjected to a controlled temperature program.

### Types of Thermal Analysis

There are several types of Thermal Analysis, including:

- **Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC)**: Measures the amount of heat absorbed or released by a sample when it is heated or cooled, providing data on heat capacity and phase transitions.

- **Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA)**: Measures the amount and rate of change in the weight of a material as a function of temperature or time in a controlled atmosphere. 

- **Dynamic Mechanical Analysis (DMA)**: Measures the mechanical properties of materials as a function of temperature, time, and frequency.

- **Thermomechanical Analysis (TMA)**: Measures dimensional changes of a material as a function of temperature.

### Applications of Thermal Analysis

Thermal Analysis has a wide range of applications in various fields such as:

- **Polymer Characterization**: For studying melting, crystallization, glass transitions, and cross-linking.

- **Pharmaceutical Industry**: For studying polymorphism, stability, and purity of drugs.

- **Food Industry**: For studying changes in food properties during heating, cooling, and storage.

- **Metallurgy**: For studying phase diagrams, purity, and reactions with the atmosphere.
