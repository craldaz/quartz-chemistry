## Cryogenic Electron Microscopy (Cryo-EM)

Cryogenic Electron Microscopy (Cryo-EM) is a form of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) where the sample is studied at cryogenic temperatures. It has become a mainstay in structural biology, allowing researchers to determine structures of a variety of specimens such as viruses, cellular components, and large molecular complexes.

### Process of Cryo-EM

1. **Sample Preparation**: The sample is rapidly frozen, typically in liquid ethane, creating a vitreous, or non-crystalline, ice layer that preserves the native structure of the sample.

2. **Imaging**: The frozen sample is then imaged in an electron microscope. Thousands of images are taken from different angles to cover the full range of orientations of the particles in the sample.

3. **Image Processing**: The images are then processed and combined to produce a 3D reconstruction of the specimen.

### Types of Cryo-EM

There are several types of Cryo-EM, including:

- **Single Particle Analysis (SPA)**: Used for studying the structure of macromolecular assemblies.
- **Cryo-Electron Tomography (Cryo-ET)**: Used to produce 3D reconstructions of objects such as cells or tissue slices.

### Applications of Cryo-EM

Cryo-EM is used in a wide range of areas including structural biology, virology, and cell biology. It has been instrumental in the study of viruses, cellular components, and large molecular complexes, providing insights into the workings of life at the molecular level.
