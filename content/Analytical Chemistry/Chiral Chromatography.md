## Chiral Chromatography

Chiral Chromatography is a type of chromatography technique used to separate stereoisomers, specifically enantiomers. It is based on the principle that different enantiomers interact differently with a chiral stationary phase.

### Process of Chiral Chromatography

1. **Sample Introduction**: The mixture of enantiomers is introduced into the chromatography system.

2. **Separation**: As the mixture flows through the column containing the chiral stationary phase, different enantiomers interact differently with the stationary phase, leading to different retention times.

3. **Detection**: The separated enantiomers are detected as they elute from the column, typically using UV-Visible absorption or mass spectrometry.

### Applications of Chiral Chromatography

Chiral Chromatography has a wide range of applications in various fields such as:

- **Chemistry**: For separating and analyzing enantiomers in chemical synthesis and research.

- **Pharmaceuticals**: For separating and analyzing enantiomers in drug development and quality control, as different enantiomers of a drug can have different biological activities.

- **Forensics**: For analyzing chiral compounds in forensic samples.
