## pH Analysis

pH Analysis is a measure of the acidity or alkalinity of a solution. It is defined as the negative logarithm (base 10) of the activity of hydronium ions (H+ or, more precisely, H3O+ aq) in a solution.

### Process of pH Analysis

1. **Sample Collection**: The sample whose pH needs to be determined is collected.

2. **Measurement**: The pH of the sample is measured using a pH meter, which consists of a special measuring probe (a glass electrode) connected to an electronic meter that displays the pH reading.

### Applications of pH Analysis

pH Analysis has a wide range of applications in various fields such as:

- **Environmental Science**: For monitoring the acidity of rain, the quality of water bodies, and the health of soils.

- **Food and Beverage Industry**: For controlling the quality of products, as pH can affect the taste, texture, and shelf life of food and beverages.

- **Pharmaceutical Industry**: For ensuring the safety and efficacy of drugs, as pH can affect the stability and absorption of drugs in the body.

- **Clinical Medicine**: For diagnosing and treating diseases, as many diseases can cause an imbalance in the body's normal pH.
