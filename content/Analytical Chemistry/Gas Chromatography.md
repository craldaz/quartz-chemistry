## Gas Chromatography

Gas Chromatography (GC) is a common type of chromatography used in analytical chemistry for separating and analyzing compounds that can be vaporized without decomposition. It is typically used to test the purity of a particular substance, or to separate different components of a mixture.

### Process of GC

1. **Sample Injection**: The sample is first vaporized and then injected into the entrance of the chromatography column.

2. **Separation**: The various components of the sample are separated inside the column. The separation is based on the different interactions of each component with the column and the carrier gas.

3. **Detection**: The separated components exit the column and reach the detector, which generates a signal proportional to the amount of component exiting the column. This generates a graph of retention time versus signal strength.

### Types of GC

There are several types of GC that differ in their stationary phase or the way the gas phase is introduced. The most common types are:

- **Gas-Solid Chromatography (GSC)**: The stationary phase is a solid surface.
- **Gas-Liquid Chromatography (GLC)**: The stationary phase is a high boiling point liquid that can be coated onto the packing of the column.

### Applications of GC

GC is used in many areas of research and testing in both the scientific and business communities. It is used in pharmaceuticals, environmental monitoring, forensics, food and beverage analysis, petrochemical and chemical analysis, and other applications.
