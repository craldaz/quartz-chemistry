## Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS)

Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS), also known as Photon Correlation Spectroscopy or Quasi-Elastic Light Scattering, is a technique used to determine the size distribution of small particles in suspension or polymers in solution. It works by detecting the random changes in the scattering of light as it is scattered by the particles.

### Process of DLS

1. **Illumination**: The sample is illuminated by a laser.

2. **Scattering**: The particles in the sample scatter the light in all directions.

3. **Detection**: The scattered light is collected at a specific angle (usually at 90 degrees) and the intensity of the light is measured over time.

4. **Analysis**: The fluctuations in the intensity of the scattered light are analyzed to determine the size distribution of the particles.

### Applications of DLS

DLS has a wide range of applications in various fields such as:

- **Chemistry**: For studying the size and behavior of molecules and particles in solution.

- **Biology**: For studying the size and behavior of biological particles, such as proteins and liposomes.

- **Material Science**: For studying the size and behavior of nanoparticles and colloids.

- **Pharmaceuticals**: For quality control and formulation development.
