## Chromatography
Chromatography is a laboratory technique for the separation of a mixture. The mixture is dissolved in a fluid called the mobile phase, which carries it through a structure holding another material called the stationary phase. The various constituents of the mixture travel at different speeds, causing them to separate.

### Types of Chromatography

There are several different types of chromatography, each with its own specific uses and requirements. Some of the most common types include:

#### Paper Chromatography

In paper chromatography, the stationary phase is a piece of high-quality filter paper. The mobile phase, a liquid solvent, travels up the paper by capillary action, carrying the sample with it.

#### Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC)

TLC is similar to paper chromatography, but instead of paper, it uses a thin layer of a substance such as alumina or silica on a flat, inert substrate.

#### Column Chromatography

In column chromatography, the sample is carried down a column filled with the stationary phase. The column can be packed with a variety of stationary phases, depending on the specific type of column chromatography being used.

#### Gas Chromatography (GC)

In GC, the mobile phase is a carrier gas, often an inert gas such as helium or an unreactive gas such as nitrogen. The stationary phase is a microscopic layer of liquid or polymer on an inert solid support, inside a piece of glass or metal tubing called a column.

#### High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC)

HPLC is a type of column chromatography used frequently in biochemistry and analytical chemistry. The stationary phase is packed into a high-pressure column so that the solvent (mobile phase) is pushed through it at high pressures.

### Applications of Chromatography

Chromatography is used in various industries and fields such as pharmaceutical, biotechnology, environmental monitoring and food and beverage. It is used to test water samples to look for pollution, in the production of pharmaceuticals, to test for the presence of illegal drugs in urine, and in many other areas.
