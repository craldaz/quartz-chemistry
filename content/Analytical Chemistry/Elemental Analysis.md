## Elemental Analysis

Elemental Analysis is a process where a sample of some material (e.g., soil, waste or drinking water, bodily fluids, minerals, chemical compounds) is analyzed for its elemental and sometimes isotopic composition. 

### Types of Elemental Analysis

There are several types of Elemental Analysis, including:
- **Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS)**: This technique uses an inductively coupled plasma to produce ions for detection by mass spectrometry. It's capable of detecting metals and several non-metals at concentrations as low as one part in 1015.
- **X-ray Fluorescence (XRF)**: An X-ray analytical technique used to determine the elemental composition of materials. XRF analyzes the interaction of X-ray with the atoms in the tested sample.
- **Neutron Activation Analysis (NAA)**: This technique involves irradiating a sample with neutrons and then measuring the resulting radioisotopes.
- **Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (AAS)**: This technique uses the absorption of light to measure the concentration of gas-phase atoms.

### Applications of Elemental Analysis

Elemental Analysis has a wide range of applications in various fields such as:

- **Environmental Studies**: For analyzing soil, water, and air samples for pollution monitoring.
- **Geology and Mining**: For determining the composition of minerals and ores.
- **Chemistry**: For determining the elemental composition of chemical compounds.
- **Forensics**: For determining the composition of evidence samples.
- **Archaeology**: For determining the composition of artifacts and their source materials.
