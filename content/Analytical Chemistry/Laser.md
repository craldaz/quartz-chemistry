## Laser

A Laser (Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation) is a device that emits light through a process of optical amplification based on the stimulated emission of electromagnetic radiation. The light it emits is usually spatially coherent, which allows it to be focused to a tight spot, and stay narrow over long distances.

### Process of Laser Operation

1. **Pumping**: Energy is supplied to the laser medium (which can be a gas, crystal or glass) to produce a population inversion.

2. **Stimulated Emission**: The excited atoms in the laser medium emit photons as they return to their ground state.

3. **Amplification**: The emitted photons stimulate further emissions of photons with the same frequency and phase, leading to amplification of the light beam.

4. **Output**: Some of the amplified light escapes through the partially reflective mirror at one end of the laser, producing the laser output.

### Applications of Lasers

Lasers have a wide range of applications in various fields such as:

- **Medicine**: For surgeries, vision correction, and cosmetic treatments.

- **Industry**: For cutting, welding, and marking of materials.

- **Telecommunications**: In fiber-optic communications.

- **Science**: In spectroscopy, holography, and as a heat source.

- **Consumer Electronics**: In devices such as optical disk drives, laser printers, and barcode scanners.
