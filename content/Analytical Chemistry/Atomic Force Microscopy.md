## Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM)

Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) is a type of scanning probe microscopy (SPM), with demonstrated resolution on the order of fractions of a nanometer. It is used to obtain high-resolution images and to measure various properties of surfaces.

### Process of AFM

1. **Scanning**: A sharp probe is scanned over the surface of the sample, and the force between the probe and the surface is measured.

2. **Interaction**: The interaction between the probe and the surface causes the cantilever to deflect, which is measured using a laser spot reflected from the top surface of the cantilever into an array of photodiodes.

3. **Image Formation**: The data collected from the interaction between the probe and the surface is used to generate an image of the surface topography.

### Types of AFM

There are several types of AFM, including:

- **Contact Mode AFM**: The tip is in continuous contact with the sample surface during scanning.
- **Non-contact Mode AFM**: The tip does not contact the sample surface.
- **Tapping Mode AFM**: The cantilever is oscillated at or near its resonance frequency.

### Applications of AFM

AFM is used in various fields such as materials science, physics, chemistry, biology, and nanotechnology. It can be used to study a variety of surfaces, including polymers, ceramics, composites, glass, and biological samples. It allows for the study of surface roughness, particle size, and other surface properties.
