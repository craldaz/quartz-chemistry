## Electrochemical Analysis

Electrochemical analysis is a type of analysis that uses the principles of electrochemistry, which is the study of chemical changes of particles caused by the movement of electrons from one element to another. Electrochemical analysis methods can be divided into several categories including potentiometric, amperometric, and coulometric methods.

### Types of Electrochemical Analysis

There are several different types of electrochemical analysis, each with its own specific uses and requirements. Some of the most common types include:

#### Potentiometry

Potentiometry is the measurement of the potential difference between two electrodes (a reference electrode and a working electrode) in an electrochemical cell. The most common application of potentiometry is pH metering.

#### Voltammetry

Voltammetry is a category of electroanalytical methods used in analytical chemistry and various industrial processes. In voltammetry, information about an analyte is obtained by measuring the current as the potential is varied.

#### Conductometry

Conductometry is a measurement of electrolytic conductivity to monitor a progress of chemical reaction. It is used in various areas such as water quality monitoring, ion chromatography, and titrations.

### Applications of Electrochemical Analysis

Electrochemical analysis is used in a wide range of areas including environmental monitoring, food quality determination, clinical applications, and many others. For example, it can be used to measure the concentration of heavy metals in water, the acidity of a solution, or the concentration of glucose in blood.
