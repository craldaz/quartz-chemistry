## Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)

Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) is a type of electron microscopy that produces images of a sample by scanning it with a focused beam of electrons. The electrons interact with atoms in the sample, producing various signals that contain information about the sample's surface topography and composition.

### Process of SEM

1. **Electron Beam Generation**: An electron gun produces a beam of high-energy electrons.

2. **Scanning**: The electron beam is focused and scanned across the sample surface.

3. **Interaction**: The electrons interact with the atoms in the sample, producing secondary electrons, backscattered electrons, and characteristic X-rays.

4. **Detection**: The signals produced by the interactions are detected and used to generate an image of the sample.

### Applications of SEM

SEM has a wide range of applications in various fields such as:

- **Material Science**: For studying the surface topography and composition of materials.

- **Biology**: For studying the surface morphology of biological samples.

- **Geology**: For studying the mineralogy and microstructure of geological samples.

- **Forensic Science**: For analyzing trace evidence in crime scene investigations.
