## X-ray Fluorescence Spectroscopy

X-ray Fluorescence (XRF) is an analytical technique used to determine the elemental composition of materials. It works by measuring the secondary (or fluorescent) X-rays emitted from a sample when it is excited by a primary X-ray source.

### Process of XRF

1. **Excitation**: The sample is irradiated with high-energy X-rays or gamma rays.

2. **Emission**: The irradiation excites electrons in the inner shells of the atoms in the sample, causing them to jump to a higher energy level. When these electrons return to their original energy level, they emit secondary X-rays.

3. **Detection**: The emitted X-rays are detected and their energies are measured. Each element has a unique set of characteristic X-ray energies, so the elements in the sample can be identified by the energies of the emitted X-rays.

### Applications of XRF

XRF has a wide range of applications in various fields such as:

- **Environmental Science**: For analyzing soil and sediment for pollution monitoring.

- **Archaeology**: For determining the composition of artifacts and their source materials.

- **Material Science**: For determining the composition of metals, glass, ceramics, and building materials.

- **Mining**: For on-site analysis of ores and minerals.
