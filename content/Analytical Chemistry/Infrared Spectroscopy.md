## Infrared Spectroscopy

Infrared Spectroscopy (IR spectroscopy) is a spectroscopic technique that uses the infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum to study molecules. It is based on the absorption of infrared radiation by molecules which leads to molecular vibrations, including bending and stretching of bonds.

### Process of Infrared Spectroscopy
1. **Irradiation**: The sample is irradiated with a broad spectrum of infrared light.

2. **Absorption**: Different frequencies of the infrared light are absorbed by the sample depending on the properties of its molecular bonds.

3. **Detection**: The absorption at various frequencies is recorded, producing an infrared spectrum which can be used to identify and analyze the sample.

### Types of Infrared Spectroscopy
There are several types of Infrared Spectroscopy, including:
- **Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR)**: A technique that collects high-resolution spectral data over a wide spectral range.
- **Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIR)**: A technique that uses the near-infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum (from about 700 nm to 2500 nm).
- **Attenuated Total Reflectance (ATR)**: A technique that can be used to analyze samples that are hard to prepare for traditional IR spectroscopy.

### Applications of Infrared Spectroscopy

Infrared Spectroscopy has a wide range of applications in various fields such as:

- **Chemistry**: For identifying and studying chemicals.

- **Pharmaceuticals**: For quality control and to determine the purity of a sample.

- **Forensic Science**: For analyzing trace evidence in crime scene investigations.

- **Environmental Science**: For studying atmospheric gases and pollutants.
