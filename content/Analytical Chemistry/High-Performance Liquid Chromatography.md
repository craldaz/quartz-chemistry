## High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC)

High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) is a type of column chromatography used frequently in biochemistry and analytical chemistry. It is used to separate, identify, and quantify each component in a mixture.

### Process of HPLC

1. **Sample Injection**: The sample mixture to be separated and analyzed is introduced into the stream of mobile phase.

2. **Separation**: The components of the sample will interact differently with the adsorbent material, leading to different flow rates for each component and thus separation of the components as they flow out of the column.

3. **Detection**: The separated components then pass into a detector, which sends signals to a computer for processing.

### Types of HPLC

There are several types of HPLC that differ in their stationary phase or the way the liquid phase is introduced. The most common types are:

- **Reverse Phase HPLC (RP-HPLC)**: The stationary phase is nonpolar and the mobile phase is polar.
- **Normal Phase HPLC (NP-HPLC)**: The stationary phase is polar and the mobile phase is nonpolar.
- **Size-Exclusion HPLC (SE-HPLC)**: Separation is based on the size of the analytes.

### Applications of HPLC

HPLC is used in a variety of industrial and scientific applications, such as pharmaceutical industry, environmental, forensic and food and beverage analysis. It is used to test pharmaceuticals, identify unknown samples, purify compounds, and measure the amounts of compounds in samples.
