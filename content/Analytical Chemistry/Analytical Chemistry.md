In an undergraduate analytical chemistry course, students are typically introduced to a variety of instrumental analysis methods. These methods are used to identify and quantify the chemical components of a sample. Here are some of the main instrumental analysis methods that are often covered:

1. **Spectroscopy**: This includes techniques such as UV-Visible Spectroscopy, Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy, and Mass Spectrometry (MS). These techniques are based on the interaction of light or other radiation with matter.

2. **Chromatography**: This includes techniques like High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC), Gas Chromatography (GC), and Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC). These techniques are used to separate mixtures of substances into their components.

3. **Electrochemical Analysis**: This includes techniques such as Potentiometry (including pH metering), Voltammetry, and Conductometry. These techniques are based on the measurement of electrical properties.

4. **Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (AAS)**: This technique is used to determine the concentration of a specific element in a sample.

5. **X-ray Diffraction (XRD)**: This technique is used to determine the crystal structure of a sample.

6. **Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP) Techniques**: These techniques, such as ICP-MS and ICP-OES, are used for the detection of trace elements in samples.

7. **Thermal Analysis**: Techniques such as Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) and Thermogravimetric Analysis (TGA) are used to study the properties of materials as they change with temperature.

These are just a few examples of the many instrumental analysis methods that might be covered in an undergraduate analytical chemistry course. The exact topics can vary depending on the specific course and institution.
