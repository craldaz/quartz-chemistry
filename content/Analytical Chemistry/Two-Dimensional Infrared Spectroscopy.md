## Two-Dimensional Infrared Spectroscopy (2D IR)

Two-Dimensional Infrared Spectroscopy (2D IR) is a nonlinear spectroscopy technique that provides information about structure and dynamics of molecules. It involves the use of two or more laser pulses to create a multidimensional spectrum that provides more detailed information than traditional infrared spectroscopy.

### Process of 2D IR

1. **Pulse Generation**: Two or more ultrafast infrared laser pulses are generated.

2. **Interaction**: The laser pulses interact with the sample, causing molecular vibrations.

3. **Detection**: The emitted or transmitted light is detected and Fourier transformed to produce a 2D spectrum.

4. **Analysis**: The 2D spectrum provides information about the frequencies of molecular vibrations and their correlations, revealing details about the structure and dynamics of the sample.

### Applications of 2D IR

2D IR has a wide range of applications in various fields such as:

- **Chemistry**: For studying the structure and dynamics of molecules, including chemical reactions and molecular interactions.

- **Biology**: For studying the structure and dynamics of biological molecules, such as proteins and lipids.

- **Material Science**: For studying the properties of materials, such as polymers and liquid crystals.
