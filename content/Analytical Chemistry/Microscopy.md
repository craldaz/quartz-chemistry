## Microscopy
Microscopy is the technical field of using microscopes to view objects and areas of objects that cannot be seen with the naked eye. There are many types of microscopes, and they can be grouped in different ways.

### Types of Microscopy

- **Optical Microscopy**: This is the oldest, simplest, and most widely used form of microscopy. Light is passed through a sample, and the microscope lens system is used to focus the light into the eye or onto a camera.

- **Electron Microscopy**: This type of microscopy uses a beam of electrons instead of light to create an image. There are two major types of electron microscopes, the Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM) and the Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM).

- **Scanning Probe Microscopy**: This type of microscopy forms images of surfaces using a physical probe that scans the specimen. An example is the Atomic Force Microscope (AFM).

- **Fluorescence Microscopy**: This type of microscopy uses fluorescence and phosphorescence instead of, or in addition to, reflection and absorption to study properties of organic or inorganic substances.

### Applications of Microscopy

Microscopy has a broad range of applications in various fields such as:

- **Biological Sciences**: For studying cells, tissues, and organisms.
- **Medical Sciences**: For diagnosing diseases and studying pathological changes in tissues.
- **Material Sciences**: For studying the structure and properties of materials.
- **Nanotechnology**: For studying and manipulating materials at the nanoscale.
