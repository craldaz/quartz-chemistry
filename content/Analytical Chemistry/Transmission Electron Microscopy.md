## Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM)

Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) is a microscopy technique in which a beam of electrons is transmitted through a specimen to form an image. The specimen is ultra-thin and electron transparent, allowing detailed examination of the sample's internal structure at a much higher resolution than light microscopes.

### Process of TEM

1. **Sample Preparation**: The sample is prepared by cutting it into thin slices, typically using a technique called ultramicrotomy.

2. **Imaging**: The prepared sample is placed in the TEM, and a beam of electrons is transmitted through the sample. The electrons interact with the atoms in the sample, which changes the direction and energy of the electrons.

3. **Detection**: The transmitted and scattered electrons are detected to form an image, which can be magnified and focused onto an imaging device, such as a fluorescent screen or a sensor.

### Types of TEM

There are several types of TEM, including:

- **Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM)**: The electron beam is focused to a fine spot and scanned over the sample in a raster.
- **High-Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy (HRTEM)**: Allows for the imaging of the detailed structure of the material, down to the level of individual columns of atoms.

### Applications of TEM

TEM is used in a wide range of scientific fields, including materials science, nanotechnology, biology, geology, and forensics. It allows for the study of the fine details of nano-scale structures, such as crystal structures, the morphology and size of particles, and the location and distribution of elements within the sample.
