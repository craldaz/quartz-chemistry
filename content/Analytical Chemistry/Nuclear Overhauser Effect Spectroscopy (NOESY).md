## 2D NMR Spectroscopy: Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy (NOESY)

Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy (NOESY) is a two-dimensional (2D) NMR spectroscopy technique used to study spatial and conformational relationships of atoms within a molecule. It is particularly useful for determining the structure of large biomolecules such as proteins and nucleic acids.

### Process of NOESY

1. **Excitation**: The sample is excited by a sequence of radiofrequency pulses.

2. **Relaxation**: During the relaxation period, magnetization transfer occurs between spatially close nuclei through the Nuclear Overhauser Effect (NOE).

3. **Detection**: The resulting signals are detected and Fourier transformed to produce a 2D spectrum.

4. **Analysis**: Cross-peaks in the NOESY spectrum indicate through-space interactions between nuclei, providing information about the spatial arrangement of atoms in the molecule.

### Applications of NOESY

NOESY has a wide range of applications in various fields such as:

- **Chemistry**: For determining the structure and conformation of small organic molecules.

- **Biochemistry**: For studying the structure and dynamics of biomolecules, such as proteins and nucleic acids.

- **Pharmaceuticals**: For studying the structure and interactions of drug molecules.
