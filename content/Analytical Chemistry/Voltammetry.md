## Voltammetry

Voltammetry is a category of electroanalytical methods used in analytical chemistry and various industrial processes. It involves the measurement of current as a function of applied potential. These methods can be used to study the speed of electron transfer, the diffusion process, and the identity of species.

### Process of Voltammetry

1. **Potential Application**: A potential is applied to the working electrode that is sufficient to oxidize or reduce the analyte of interest.

2. **Current Measurement**: The current resulting from the oxidation or reduction process is measured. The current is proportional to the concentration of the analyte.

3. **Potential Sweep**: The potential is then swept back in the opposite direction, which causes the analyte to be reduced or oxidized in the opposite direction.

### Types of Voltammetry

There are several types of voltammetry, including:

- **Cyclic Voltammetry (CV)**: The working electrode potential is ramped linearly versus time.
- **Linear Sweep Voltammetry (LSV)**: The potential is swept in one direction.
- **Differential Pulse Voltammetry (DPV)**: A series of fixed potential pulses is superimposed on a linearly increasing baseline potential.

### Applications of Voltammetry

Voltammetry has a wide range of applications, including the determination of organic and inorganic substances in pharmaceutical, food, and environmental analysis. It is also used in the study of reaction mechanisms, the determination of active surface areas of electrodes, and the study of adsorption processes.
