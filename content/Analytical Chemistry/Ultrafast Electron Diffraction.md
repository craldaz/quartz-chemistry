## Ultrafast Electron Diffraction

Ultrafast Electron Diffraction (UED) is a technique used to study the structural dynamics of molecules, surfaces, and bulk materials on an ultrafast time scale (femtoseconds to picoseconds). It involves the use of ultrafast electron pulses to probe the system of interest.

### Process of Ultrafast Electron Diffraction

1. **Electron Pulse Generation**: Ultrafast electron pulses are generated, typically using a femtosecond laser and a photoemission process.

2. **Irradiation**: The sample is irradiated with the electron pulses.

3. **Diffraction**: The electrons are diffracted by the sample, creating a diffraction pattern.

4. **Detection**: The diffraction pattern is detected and analyzed, providing information about the atomic structure and dynamics of the sample.

### Applications of Ultrafast Electron Diffraction

Ultrafast Electron Diffraction has a wide range of applications in various fields such as:

- **Chemistry**: For studying ultrafast chemical reactions and processes.

- **Physics**: For studying ultrafast processes in physical systems, such as phase transitions and electron dynamics.

- **Material Science**: For studying ultrafast processes in materials, such as structural changes and carrier dynamics.
