## Prism (Diffraction Grating)

A prism, in the context of a diffraction grating, is an optical component with a periodic structure that splits and diffracts light into several beams travelling in different directions. The directions of these beams depend on the spacing of the grating and the wavelength of the light.

### Role in Absorption Spectroscopy

In absorption spectroscopy, a prism (diffraction grating) is used to separate the different wavelengths of light before they are absorbed by the sample. This allows the absorption of each wavelength to be measured separately, providing a spectrum that reveals information about the sample's composition and structure.

1. **Incident Light**: Light from a source is directed onto the prism.

2. **Diffraction**: The prism diffracts the light into its component wavelengths.

3. **Absorption**: The separated light is passed through the sample. Different wavelengths are absorbed by the sample to different extents.

4. **Detection**: The intensity of the transmitted light at each wavelength is measured, providing an absorption spectrum of the sample.

### Applications of Prisms in Spectroscopy

Prisms (diffraction gratings) are used in various types of spectroscopy, including:

- **UV-Visible Spectroscopy**: For studying the absorption of ultraviolet and visible light by molecules.

- **Infrared Spectroscopy**: For studying the absorption of infrared light by molecules, revealing information about their vibrational modes.

- **Raman Spectroscopy**: For studying the scattering of light by molecules, revealing information about their vibrational modes.
