# Inorganic Chemistry

**Inorganic chemistry** is the study of the properties and behaviors of inorganic compounds. This field covers all chemical compounds except the myriad organic compounds (carbon-based compounds, usually containing C-H bonds), which are the subjects of organic chemistry.

## Overview

Inorganic chemistry has applications in every aspect of the chemical industry, including catalysis, materials science, pigments, surfactants, coatings, medicine, fuel, and agriculture. 

## Subdisciplines

Inorganic chemistry is divided into two main areas: descriptive and theoretical inorganic chemistry. Descriptive inorganic chemistry focuses on the classification of compounds based on their properties, while theoretical inorganic chemistry uses physics to explain the behavior of inorganic compounds.

## Key Concepts

Inorganic chemistry encompasses the compounds - both molecular and extended solids - of everything else in the periodic table, and overlaps with organic chemistry in the area of organometallic chemistry, in which metals are bonded to carbon.

## Applications

Inorganic chemistry is used in the field of materials science to study the properties of minerals, ceramics, and metals. Inorganic compounds are also used in the field of environmental chemistry, as they play a key role in the processes that occur in the Earth's atmosphere, oceans, and living organisms.
