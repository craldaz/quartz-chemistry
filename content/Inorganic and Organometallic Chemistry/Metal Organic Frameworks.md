## Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs)
Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs) are a class of compounds consisting of metal ions or clusters coordinated to [organic ligands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligand) to form one-, two-, or three-dimensional structures.

### Overview
MOFs are known for their high porosity and large surface area, which make them useful in a variety of applications, including gas storage, separation, and catalysis. The structure of a MOF results in a material with more surface area in a given volume than any known substance, which is an asset in many of the applications for which MOFs are used.

### Structure and Properties
The structure of MOFs is characterized by a regular, repeating network composed of metal ions or clusters (also known as secondary building units) and organic ligands. These components are assembled to create porous structures. The choice of metal and ligand components allows for a high degree of tunability in the properties of the resulting MOF, including pore size, shape, and functionality.

### Applications
MOFs have found use in a wide range of applications. They are used in gas storage (such as hydrogen storage for fuel cell vehicles), in carbon capture and storage technologies to help mitigate climate change, and in chemical sensing and detection applications. MOFs can also serve as catalysts or as supports for catalysts in various chemical reactions.
