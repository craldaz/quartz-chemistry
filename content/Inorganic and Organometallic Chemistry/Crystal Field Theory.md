# Crystal Field Theory

**Crystal Field Theory (CFT)** is a model that describes the breaking of degeneracies of electron orbital states, usually d or f orbitals, due to a static electric field produced by a surrounding charge distribution (anion neighbors). This theory, developed by physicists Hans Bethe and John Hasbrouck Van Vleck in the 1930s, is used in inorganic chemistry to explain the colors, magnetism, and other properties of transition metal complexes.

## Overview

CFT focuses on the nonbonding electrons on the central metal ion of a complex. It assumes that the interactions between the metal ions and ligands are purely electrostatic. The theory is based on the idea that the five degenerate d-orbitals will split into different energy levels when in the presence of ligands.

## Splitting of d-orbitals

In an octahedral environment, the d-orbitals split into two sets with different energy levels. The d_xy, d_xz, and d_yz orbitals are of higher energy and are known as the e_g set. The d_z^2 and d_x^2-y^2 orbitals are of lower energy and are known as the t_2g set.

## Spectrochemical Series

The spectrochemical series is a list of ligands ordered on ligand field strength. Ligands at the bottom of the series cause small splitting of the d-orbitals (weak-field ligands) while those at the top cause large splitting (strong-field ligands).

## Limitations

While CFT is useful for explaining many properties of transition metal complexes, it has limitations. It does not take into account the covalent character of the bonding in many complexes, which is better explained by Ligand Field Theory (LFT) and Molecular Orbital Theory (MOT).
