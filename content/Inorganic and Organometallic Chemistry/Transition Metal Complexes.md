# Transition Metal Complexes

**Transition metal complexes** are chemical compounds containing transition metal ions surrounded by ligands. They are a central part of inorganic chemistry and are key to understanding the behavior of transition metals, which are found in the middle of the periodic table.

## Overview

Transition metal complexes consist of a central metal atom or ion, which is bonded to one or more surrounding atoms, ions, or molecules known as ligands. These ligands can be a variety of substances, including water, ammonia, or chloride ions. The number of ligands attached to the metal ion is called the coordination number.

## Structure

The structure of transition metal complexes can vary widely, but they often adopt octahedral, tetrahedral, or square planar geometries. The geometry is determined by the arrangement of the ligands around the metal ion.

## Properties

Transition metal complexes often have distinctive colors, which arise from the absorption of certain wavelengths of light by the d-electrons of the metal ion. They can also exhibit a variety of magnetic properties, depending on the number of unpaired electrons in the metal ion.

## Applications

Transition metal complexes have many important applications. They are used as catalysts in a variety of industrial processes, including the production of polymers and the synthesis of organic compounds. They are also used in medicine, for example in chemotherapy drugs, and in technology, for example in OLEDs (organic light-emitting diodes).
