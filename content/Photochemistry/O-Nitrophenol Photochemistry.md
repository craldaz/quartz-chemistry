## Ortho-Nitrophenol

Ortho-Nitrophenol (o-Nitrophenol or 2-Nitrophenol) is an organic compound with the chemical formula C6H5NO3. It is one of the three isomeric nitrophenols, the other two being meta-nitrophenol and para-nitrophenol.

## Research
Work by Thomas Wolf: photolysis of o-NP, 
- S1 pi-pi*
- ESIPT mechanims
- Rotation of HONO group leads to S1/S0
- Separation of HONO group likely on triplet manifold (TREPS) 

EOM-CCSD 
- Weird results when choosing 5 vs 10 states 
- if close to a state, the eigenstates can converge to it? no, it depends on the algorithm. E.g. [[Davidson Algorithm]]
- Shift  [[Power Method]] [[Raleigh Ritz Method]]
- If you start from bottom and going up then you can easily miss something that has poor overlap 
- So when doing 5 states, it misses a solution.
- Diagonalization is only convex when you diagonalize the whole matrix (The only minimum of [[Raleigh Ritz Method]] is minimum). However, the other solutions are saddle points so they are susceptible 
- What is the upper bound? Like 10? Or more?



## Properties

o-Nitrophenol is a pale yellow crystalline solid with a characteristic pungent smell. It is soluble in alcohol, ether, and slightly soluble in water due to the presence of an -OH group. The presence of the nitro group at the ortho position to the hydroxyl group makes o-nitrophenol more acidic than phenol.

## Environmental Impact

It has been implicated in acid rain, contributing to environmental pollution. The compound is released into the atmosphere as a result of several industrial processes and can also form as a byproduct of combustion.

## Photochemistry

The photochemistry of o-Nitrophenol is a topic of interest due to the compound's light-sensitive properties. Upon exposure to light, it undergoes photodissociation, which can result in the formation of nitrous oxide (HONO)

In the context of o-Nitrophenol, the hydroxyl (-OH) group acts as the electron donor (push), and the nitro (-NO2) group acts as the electron acceptor (pull). This [[Push-Pull Photochemistry]] effect can lead to interesting photochemical properties and reactions.

In the case of o-Nitrophenol, the molecule contains a hydroxyl group (-OH) adjacent to a nitro group (-NO2). When the molecule absorbs light, it's believed that a proton from the hydroxyl group can be transferred to the oxygen of the nitro group in an [[Excited-State Intramolecular Proton Transfer | ESIPT]] process. The intramolecular proton transfer can dramatically affect the photochemical and photophysical properties of the molecule, leading to unique behavior that's of interest in various areas of chemistry and materials science.
