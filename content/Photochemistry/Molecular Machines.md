### Molecular Machines

**Molecular Machines** are assemblies of molecular components designed to perform mechanical tasks at the nanoscale. The development of these machines represented a significant breakthrough in nanotechnology, leading to the awarding of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2016.

#### Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2016

The prize was awarded to Jean-Pierre Sauvage, Fraser Stoddart, and Bernard Feringa for their individual contributions to the design and synthesis of molecular machines.

1. **Jean-Pierre Sauvage**: For the synthesis of catenanes, interlinked ring molecules that allow controlled rotation.
2. **J. Fraser Stoddart**: For the development of rotaxanes, molecules composed of a ring threaded onto an axle, enabling controlled linear movement.
3. **Bernard Feringa**: For creating the first molecular motor, capable of unidirectional rotation.

#### Key Concepts

- **Catenanes**: Interlinked rings with free movement relative to each other.
- **Rotaxanes**: Mechanically-interlocked molecules where a macrocycle is threaded onto an axle.
- **Molecular Motors**: Molecules capable of converting energy into directed movement.

#### Applications

- **Drug Delivery**: Targeting drugs to specific cells.
- **Nano-Robots**: Potential to create tiny robots capable of performing specific tasks.
- **Smart Materials**: Developing materials that can change properties in response to stimuli.

#### Challenges

- **Synthesis**: Complexity in designing and synthesizing the components.
- **Control**: Precise control of movement and functions.
- **Scale-Up**: Translating nanoscale functions to macroscopic applications.
