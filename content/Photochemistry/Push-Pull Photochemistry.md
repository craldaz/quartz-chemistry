Push-pull photochemistry is a term that refers to a specific type of photochemical reaction involving molecules with distinct electron-donating (push) and electron-withdrawing (pull) groups. These molecules are also known as "push-pull" molecules.

The term "push-pull" comes from the way the electron density in these molecules can be redistributed or "pushed and pulled" when the molecule absorbs light. This absorption promotes the molecule to an excited state, causing a shift in electron density. The electronic structure rearranges such that the electron-donating group pushes electron density toward the electron-withdrawing group.

This intramolecular charge transfer results in a polar excited state, which can have significantly different chemical properties from the ground state molecule. This transition to a polar excited state can enable various photochemical reactions to occur. It's a fundamental concept in photochemistry and is often leveraged in the design of dyes, solar cells, and other light-responsive materials.
