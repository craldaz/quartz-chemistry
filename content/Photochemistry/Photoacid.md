Sure, here is a Wikipedia-style markdown note on photoacids:

## Photoacid

A Photoacid is a type of [chemical compound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound) that releases a proton (H+) when exposed to light, thus behaving as an acid. 

### Overview

Photoacids are unique because their acidity is light-dependent. Under normal conditions, they may not behave as acids, but when they absorb light, they undergo a structural change that allows them to release a proton. This property makes them useful in a variety of scientific and industrial applications.

### Mechanism

The mechanism of action for a photoacid involves the absorption of light, which promotes the molecule to an excited state. In this state, the molecule is more acidic than in the ground state, and it can release a proton. When the molecule returns to the ground state, it can accept a proton again.

### Applications

Photoacids have a wide range of applications, including in the development of photoresists for semiconductor manufacturing, in the study of fast proton transfer reactions in chemistry and biology, and in the design of materials with light-responsive properties.
