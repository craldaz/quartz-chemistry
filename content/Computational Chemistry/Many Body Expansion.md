[[Vinicius]], Harry Zhang, 


## Harry Zhang
2022-09-02 presented his undergraduate work on a graph theoretical approach for calculating the MBE. 

In this approach a "[[Simplex]]" defines a body.

A rank 0 body is a node itself, a rank 1 body is an edge, a rank 2 body is a triangle, a rank 3 body is a tetrahedral.  The algorithm then amounts to finding the cliques in the graph given a certain rank and edge cutoff.
