# Hit Discovery
Hit Discovery is a crucial phase in the drug discovery process, particularly within the field of
computational chemistry. It involves the identification of promising compounds, known as "hits,"
that interact with a target of interest in a biologically relevant manner.
## Overview
In computational chemistry, Hit Discovery often involves the use of in silico techniques such as
virtual screening and molecular docking. These methods allow for the rapid evaluation of large
libraries of compounds, identifying those that are most likely to bind to the target with high
affinity.
Virtual screening involves the use of computer algorithms to predict the likelihood that a
particular compound will bind to the target. This can be based on a variety of factors, including
the compound's chemical structure and physical properties.
Molecular docking, on the other hand, involves predicting the orientation of a molecule when it
binds to a specific target to form a stable complex. The predictions are typically based on the
minimization of free energy upon binding.
## Applications
Hit Discovery is a critical step in the early stages of drug discovery. The hits identified during covery
this phase serve as starting points for further optimization and development. This can involve
medicinal chemistry techniques to improve the hit's potency, selectivity, and pharmacokinetic
properties.
