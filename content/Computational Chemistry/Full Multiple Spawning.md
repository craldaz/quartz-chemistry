# `Title:` [[Full Multiple Spawning]]
--- 

Full multiple spawning approximates the total wavefunction as a linear combination of frozen gaussians known as trajectory basis functions (TBFs).

The number of TBFs increases during the course of a simulation when the system encounters a region of large coupling interstate coupling (to allow for population transfer.)

This method is formally exact in the limit of a large number of TBFs.
