# Free-Wilson Analysis

Free-Wilson analysis is a method used in medicinal chemistry for the quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) studies. This method was originally published in 1964 by Free and Wilson.

## Overview

The Free-Wilson analysis is a simple method that can be illustrated through an example. It involves the use of a matrix to analyze the structure-activity relationship of a series of compounds. The method is particularly useful in drug discovery and development, where it can help to predict the biological activity of new compounds based on their chemical structure.

## Example

An example of the application of Free-Wilson analysis can be found in a 1998 review by Hugo Kubinyi. In this review, Kubinyi demonstrates the use of Free-Wilson analysis in the study of a series of compounds and their biological activity.
