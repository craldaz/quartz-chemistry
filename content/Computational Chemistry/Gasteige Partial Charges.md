# Gasteiger Partial Charges

**Gasteiger partial charges**, also known as **Gasteiger-Marsili charges**, are a type of partial atomic charges computed using a method developed by Johann Gasteiger and Mario Marsili. 

## Overview

Gasteiger partial charges are calculated based on the principle of electronegativity equalization. This method assumes that the total molecular electronegativity is distributed over the atoms in such a way that the resulting atomic electronegativities are equal.

The Gasteiger-Marsili method is an empirical method that does not require knowledge of the molecular geometry. It is computationally efficient and can be applied to large molecules.

## Applications

Gasteiger partial charges are widely used in chemoinformatics and molecular modeling, particularly in the fields of drug design and QSAR studies. They are used to calculate molecular properties that depend on the charge distribution, such as dipole moments and polarizabilities.
