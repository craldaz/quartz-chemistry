The difference in the transition state energies for the two reaction pathways is often a  useful descriptor in terms of understanding and predicting selectivity. This can be represented as Î”Î”E^â€¡, which is the difference in activation energies between two transition states leading to two different products or regioisomers.

In the context of a multiple linear free-energy relationship, the Î”Î”E^â€¡ could be modeled as a function of different molecular descriptors. Here's an example:

```
Î”Î”E^â€¡ = Î²0 + Î²1*Ïƒ1 + Î²2*Es1 + Î²3*Ïƒ2 + Î²4*Es2 + ... + Îµ
```

In this equation, Ïƒ1 and Ïƒ2 could be the Hammett parameters for two different parts of the molecule, Es1 and Es2 could be the Taft parameters for two different parts of the molecule, and Îµ is the error term. Î²0, Î²1, Î²2, etc., are the regression coefficients that quantify the impact of each descriptor on Î”Î”E^â€¡.

This model provides a way to predict how changes in the molecular structure or the catalyst will influence the difference in transition state energies, and hence, the selectivity of the reaction. By minimizing Î”Î”E^â€¡, you can potentially increase the selectivity towards the desired regioisomer.

As always, predictions made from this model should be experimentally validated to confirm their accuracy, as the model provides correlative relationships, not necessarily causal ones.
