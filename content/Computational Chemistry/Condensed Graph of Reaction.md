# Condensed Graph of Reaction (CGR)

Condensed Graph of Reaction (CGR) is a concept in chemoinformatics that represents a chemical reaction as a single graph. It was first introduced by Jean-Loup Faulon and his team in 2003. CGR is a powerful tool for the analysis and prediction of chemical reactions.

## Overview

CGR is a graph that merges the reactants and products of a chemical reaction into a single entity. It captures the structural changes that occur during a reaction, making it possible to analyze and predict reactions in a systematic way.

## Structure

A CGR is constructed by superimposing the reactant and product graphs of a reaction. The vertices of the CGR represent atoms, and the edges represent bonds. Atoms that do not change during the reaction are represented by static vertices, while atoms that do change are represented by dynamic vertices. Similarly, bonds that do not change are represented by static edges, while bonds that do change are represented by dynamic edges.

## Applications

CGR has been used in a variety of applications in chemoinformatics, including:

- **Reaction Classification**: CGR can be used to classify reactions based on their structural changes.

- **Reaction Prediction**: CGR can be used to predict the products of a reaction given the reactants, or vice versa.

- **Reaction Database Search**: CGR can be used to search reaction databases for reactions with specific structural changes.

## Advantages and Limitations

The main advantage of CGR is its ability to represent the structural changes of a reaction in a compact and systematic way. This makes it a powerful tool for analyzing and predicting reactions.

However, CGR has some limitations. It does not capture the dynamics of a reaction, such as the reaction mechanism or the energy changes that occur. It also does not capture stereochemistry, which can be important in many reactions.
