# De Novo Drug Discovery

De Novo drug discovery is a strategy in medicinal chemistry that involves the design and synthesis of novel chemical entities (NCEs) from scratch, rather than relying on the modification of pre-existing molecules. The term "de novo" is derived from Latin, meaning "from the beginning".

## Overview

De Novo drug discovery is a complex, iterative process that involves the integration of various computational and experimental techniques. The goal is to design molecules with optimal interactions with a specific biological target, while also possessing suitable pharmacokinetic and safety profiles.

## Process

The process typically involves the following steps:

1. **Target Identification**: The first step is to identify a suitable biological target, such as a protein, that is involved in the disease of interest.

2. **Design of Novel Molecules**: Using computational methods, novel molecules are designed to interact with the target. This often involves the use of molecular modeling and simulation techniques.

3. **Synthesis and Testing**: The designed molecules are then synthesized in the lab and tested for their ability to interact with the target and their biological activity.

4. **Optimization**: Based on the results of the testing, the molecules are further optimized to improve their potency, selectivity, and pharmacokinetic properties.

## Advantages and Challenges

De Novo drug discovery has the potential to discover truly novel drugs that are not limited by the structures of existing molecules. However, it is a challenging process that requires significant resources and expertise. The design of novel molecules is a complex task that requires a deep understanding of the target and the factors that influence molecular interactions. Furthermore, the synthesis of the designed molecules can be challenging and time-consuming.
