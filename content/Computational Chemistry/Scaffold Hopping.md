Scaffold hopping is a concept in medicinal chemistry where one part (the "scaffold") of a molecule is replaced while maintaining the overall activity of the molecule. This is often done to improve the drug-like properties of the molecule, such as its solubility, stability, or ability to be absorbed in the body.

In the context of drug discovery, scaffold hopping is used to:

1. Overcome patent barriers: By changing the core structure of a molecule, a new, patentable compound can be created that still has the desired activity.

2. Improve drug properties: If a molecule has undesirable properties, such as poor solubility or stability, scaffold hopping can be used to improve these properties while maintaining the molecule's activity.

3. Avoid toxicity: If a particular scaffold is associated with toxicity, it can be replaced with a different scaffold to avoid this issue.

4. Explore the structure-activity relationship (SAR): Scaffold hopping can be used to explore the SAR of a series of compounds, helping to understand how changes in structure affect the compound's activity.

Scaffold hopping can be achieved through several methods, including molecular overlay, pharmacophore mapping, and molecular docking.
