# Density Functional Theory

Density Functional Theory (DFT) is a computational quantum mechanical modelling method used in physics, chemistry and materials science to investigate the electronic structure (principally the ground state) of many-body systems, in particular atoms, molecules, and the condensed phases.

## Overview

The main assumption behind DFT is that the total energy of a system can be determined solely by the electron density, rather than the many-body wavefunction. This simplifies the calculations, making it possible to study larger systems and longer timescales than would be feasible with methods that require the full wavefunction.

DFT has been very popular for calculations in both physics and chemistry since the 1990s. It is used to investigate a wide range of properties of atoms, molecules and solids, including bond energies, bond lengths, ionization potentials, electron affinities, and total energies.

## Applications

DFT is widely used in condensed matter physics and physical chemistry, but also in theoretical chemistry, materials science, and solid-state physics. It has been used to model a wide range of systems and phenomena, including superconductors, semiconductors, magnetism, surface phenomena, and chemical reactions.
