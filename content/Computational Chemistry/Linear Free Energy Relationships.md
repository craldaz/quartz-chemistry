# Linear Free-Energy Relationships

Linear free-energy relationships (LFER) are mathematical models used in physical organic chemistry, medicinal chemistry, environmental chemistry, and pharmacology to explore the relationship between reaction rates and equilibrium constants with the structure of molecules.

## Overview

LFERs are used to quantify and predict the effect of changing structure on the kinetic or thermodynamic properties of chemical reactions. They are particularly useful in estimating the effect of systematic structural changes on reactivity or selectivity, for instance, how reactivity changes when a hydrogen atom in a molecule is replaced by a chlorine atom. 

## Hammett Equation

The Hammett equation, developed by Louis Plack Hammett in 1937, is a prototype for all LFERs. This equation relates the equilibrium or rate constant of a reaction (or the pKa of an acid) to the properties of substituents elsewhere in the molecule. The Hammett equation can be written as:

```
log(k / k0) = œÉœÅ
```

Here, 'k' is the rate constant or equilibrium constant for a reaction involving a substituted system, while 'k0' is the rate constant or equilibrium constant for the same reaction in the unsubstituted system. 'œÉ' is the substituent constant (Hammett constant), which depends on the nature of the substituent, and 'œÅ' is the reaction constant, which depends on the nature of the reaction.

### Hammett Parameters

Hammett parameters, or œÉ values, are used in the Hammett equation. They describe the electronic effects of substituents on benzenes in the context of reaction mechanisms. The parameter measures the electron-withdrawing or electron-donating power of a substituent relative to a hydrogen atom.

The value of œÉ for a given substituent is determined experimentally by measuring the effect of the substituent on the ionization of benzoic acid in water. The resulting set of œÉ values, covering a wide range of substituents, forms the basis for the Hammett plot. 

Hammett parameters have been enormously useful in understanding the mechanistic aspects of organic reactions. For example, a positive œÅ value in the Hammett equation indicates a mechanism involving a buildup of positive charge, whereas a negative œÅ value indicates buildup of negative charge.
