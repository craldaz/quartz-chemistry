# Quantitative Estimate of Druglikeness (QED)

Quantitative Estimate of Druglikeness (QED) is a measure used in drug discovery to estimate the "drug-likeness" or pharmaceutical quality of a chemical compound. It is a predictive model used to evaluate the potential of a compound to be developed into a drug.

## Overview

The QED score is a composite measure that takes into account various molecular properties important in determining pharmaceutical quality. It is designed to help medicinal chemists during the drug discovery process to identify compounds with optimal drug-like properties.

## Key Concepts

### Molecular Properties

The QED score is calculated based on several molecular properties, including molecular weight, lipophilicity, hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, aromatic rings, and rotatable bonds. These properties are important for a drug's absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) profile.

### Weighted and Unweighted QED

There are two versions of the QED score: unweighted and weighted. The unweighted version treats all molecular properties equally, while the weighted version assigns different weights to different properties based on their perceived importance in determining drug-likeness.

## Applications

The QED score is used in drug discovery to prioritize compounds for further development. It can be used to guide the design of new compounds with improved drug-like properties, and to predict the drug-likeness of compounds identified in high-throughput screening campaigns.
