Flare is a computational drug design software developed by Cresset. It is designed for both ligand-
based and structure-based drug design, providing high-resolution 3D visualization and in-depth
analysis of target structures and potential ligands.
## Overview
Flare is used by computational and medicinal chemists across various sectors, including
pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, academia, and other industries. It serves as a 'computational
toolbox' that allows users to closely inspect the details of their ligand-protein complexes and
apply a variety of methods to gain insights into their protein targets and ligand series.

## Features
Flare offers a range of features to support drug designers in their lead optimization process.
These include:
- **High-Resolution 3D Visualization**: Flare provides high-resolution 3D graphics for visualizing target structures and potential ligands, aiding in the development of a comprehensive understanding of molecular interactions and binding.
- **Conformational Hunt and Alignment**

- **Free Energy Perturbation (FEP) Calculations**: Flare uses cutting-edge FEP calculations to accurately predict the activity of congeneric ligands.
- **Integration with TorxÂ®**: Flare seamlessly integrates with TorxÂ®, enabling communication with colleagues across the Drug Discovery, Development, and Manufacturing cycle.
-  **Electrostatic Complementarityâ„¢**: This unique feature visualizes and scores the electrostatic complementarity between the protein and ligand, providing insights into potential improvements in binding efficiency.

- **WaterSwap and 3D-RISM**: These advanced methods provide accurate predictions of the binding affinities of ligands.

By using Flare, chemists can prioritize the best molecules for lab experiments, leading to a
significant reduction in time, energy, and lab resources, and increasing the chances of success in
later-stage drug development.
