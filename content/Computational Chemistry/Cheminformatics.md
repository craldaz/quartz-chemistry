# Cheminformatics

## Overview

Cheminformatics (also known as chemoinformatics, chemioinformatics and chemical informatics) is an interdisciplinary field that applies the techniques of computer and information science to the management and analysis of large chemical databases. It uses computer storage and processing to facilitate and enhance various aspects of chemical research, including the design of new drugs.

## Applications

Cheminformatics can be applied in various fields such as drug discovery, data mining, and predictive analytics. Its techniques can be used to predict the structure of molecules, the properties of chemical compounds, and the interactions between different molecules.

## Techniques

Cheminformatics involves the use of various computational techniques such as:

- **Molecular modeling:** This involves the use of computational chemistry to model molecular structures and properties.

- **Data mining:** This involves the use of algorithms to analyze large chemical databases and discover patterns or relationships.

- **Machine learning:** This involves the use of artificial intelligence to predict the properties or behaviors of chemical compounds.

## History

The term "cheminformatics" was first used in the late 1990s. However, the field itself has been around for much longer, with the use of computational techniques in chemistry dating back to the mid-20th century.

## Future Directions

With the increasing availability of large chemical databases and advances in computational power, cheminformatics is expected to play an increasingly important role in chemical research and drug discovery in the future.
