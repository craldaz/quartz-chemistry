### AlphaFold

**AlphaFold** is a deep learning program developed by [DeepMind](https://deepmind.com) that predicts [protein folding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_folding). Protein folding is the biological process by which a protein chain acquires its three-dimensional structure, a conformation in which it becomes biologically functional.

#### Development

AlphaFold's approach uses deep neural networks, trained on a large dataset of known protein structures. Utilizing attention mechanisms similar to [Transformers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer_(machine_learning_model)) in natural language processing, it captures long-range interactions between amino acids in the protein chain.

#### Achievements

AlphaFold made a significant breakthrough in 2020 by winning the 14th Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction ([CASP14](https://predictioncenter.org/casp14/)) competition. It demonstrated unparalleled accuracy in predicting protein structures, a success seen as a major step towards solving the decades-old challenge of the protein-folding problem.

#### Applications

The potential applications of AlphaFold's technology span various fields, including drug discovery, enzymology, and understanding genetic diseases. Its ability to predict protein structures with high accuracy enables more efficient research and offers insights into biological processes and mechanisms.

#### Impact

The introduction of AlphaFold has spurred interest and innovation in the intersection of computational methods and biological research, marking a substantial advancement in the field of computational biology.
