Sure, here is a Wikipedia-style markdown note on Delocalized Internal Coordinates (DLIC) in computational chemistry:

## Delocalized Internal Coordinates (DLIC)

Delocalized Internal Coordinates (DLIC) are a type of coordinate system used in computational chemistry to describe the geometry of molecules.

### Overview

In computational chemistry, the geometry of a molecule is often described using a set of coordinates. These can be Cartesian coordinates (x, y, z positions of each atom) or internal coordinates (bond lengths, bond angles, and dihedral angles). Delocalized Internal Coordinates are a type of internal coordinate that are not associated with a specific bond, angle, or dihedral in a molecule, but rather are spread out or "delocalized" over the entire molecule.

### Use in Computational Chemistry

DLIC are particularly useful in quantum chemistry calculations, where they can help to more accurately describe the motion of atoms in a molecule. They are often used in methods such as vibrational analysis, potential energy surface exploration, and transition state search algorithms.

### Advantages and Disadvantages

The use of DLIC can provide a more accurate and efficient description of molecular geometry compared to localized internal coordinates, particularly for large molecules. However, the calculation of DLIC can be more complex and computationally intensive.
