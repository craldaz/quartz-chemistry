# Tox21

The **Toxicology in the 21st Century** (abbreviated as **Tox21**) is a collaboration that aims to improve our understanding of toxicology through the development and use of alternative testing strategies. These strategies seek to reduce the reliance on traditional animal testing methods.

## Overview

Tox21 is a collaborative effort between several U.S. federal agencies including:

- The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
- The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS)
- The National Toxicology Program (NTP)
- The National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS)
- The Food and Drug Administration (FDA)

The goal of Tox21 is to quickly and efficiently predict how chemicals will affect human health and the environment. The program uses innovative methods such as high-throughput screening and computational modeling to predict potential toxicity.

## Impact

Tox21 has the potential to revolutionize toxicology by improving the speed and accuracy of toxicity testing, reducing the need for animal testing, and providing a better understanding of the mechanisms of chemical toxicity. The data generated by Tox21 is publicly available and can be used by researchers and regulatory agencies around the world.
