## Metadynamics

Metadynamics is a computer simulation method in computational chemistry used to calculate free energy landscapes and explore the energy landscape of molecular systems.

### Overview

Metadynamics was introduced by Laio and Parrinello in 2002 as a method to escape the local minima problem in molecular dynamics simulations. It works by adding a history-dependent bias potential to the potential energy surface, which helps the system to overcome energy barriers and explore new regions of the phase space.

### Use in Computational Chemistry

Metadynamics is used to study a wide range of chemical and biological systems, including protein folding, chemical reactions in solution, and materials under pressure. It is particularly useful for studying rare events, such as chemical reactions or conformational changes, that are difficult to observe in standard molecular dynamics simulations.

### Calculation of Free Energies

One of the key advantages of metadynamics is its ability to calculate free energy landscapes. By adding a bias potential that depends on a set of collective variables (CVs), metadynamics allows the system to explore a wide range of configurations and calculate the free energy as a function of the CVs. This makes it a powerful tool for studying processes such as chemical reactions, phase transitions, and protein-ligand binding.
