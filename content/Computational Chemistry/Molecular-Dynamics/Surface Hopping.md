# `Title:` [[Surface Hopping]]	
--- 


## Overview

Surface hopping accounts for these limitations by propagating an ensemble of trajectories, each one of them on a single adiabatic surface at any given time. The trajectories are allowed to 'hop' between various adiabatic states at certain times such that the [quantum amplitudes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_amplitude) for the adiabatic states follow the time dependent SchrÃ¶dinger equation. The probability of these hops are dependent on the coupling between the states, and is generally significant only in the regions where the difference between adiabatic energies is small.

## General procedure

- Initialize a classical trajectory on a single state
- Stochastically hop between surfaces
	- Governed by the electronic expansion coefficients
- Adjust momentum and continue the trajectory on the new state


Tully's fewest switching algorithm is the seminal paper in this field. 

## Problems:

â€¢Over-coherence problem

â€¢Frustrated hops

â€¢Momentum adjustment
