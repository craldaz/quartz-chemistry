# `Title:` [[Born-Huang Approximation]]
--- 

This is a slight modification of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation that takes into account the diagonal nonadiabatic effects in the electronic wavefunction.


This diagonal born-oppenheimer correction is not evaluated in AIMS. Why not?

â€¢Analytic evaluation ends up requiring a sum over all electronic states, which is intractable

â€¢It tends to raise the energy of conical intersection points, slowing the effective rate of population transfer (this is related to wavefunction discontinuities in the adiabatic states)

â€¢A similar justification is used for neglecting the 2nd derivative non-adiabatic coupling
