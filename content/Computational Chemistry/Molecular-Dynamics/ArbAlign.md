[[Alex Chang]] is using this in the [[Nanoreactor]] to determine unique molecules

May also be useful for [[mechanism atom indexing problem]]

When assessing the similarity between two isomers whose atoms are ordered identically, one typically translates and rotates their Cartesian coordinates for best alignment and computes the pairwise root-mean-square distance (RMSD). However, if the atoms are ordered differently or the molecular axes are switched, it is necessary to find the best ordering of the atoms and check for optimal axes before calculating a meaningful pairwise RMSD.
