# Matched Molecular Pairs

Matched Molecular Pairs (MMPs) is a computational technique used in the field of chemoinformatics. It was first described in a paper by Jameed Hussain and Ceara Rea in 2010.

## Definition

Matched Molecular Pairs refers to a methodology where pairs of molecules are identified that only differ by a single, well-defined structural modification. This technique is used to systematically analyze the effect of these modifications on a specific property of the molecules.
