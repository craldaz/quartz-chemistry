## Light-Emitting Diode (LED)

A Light-Emitting Diode (LED) is a semiconductor light source that emits light when current flows through it. It operates on the principle of electroluminescence, converting electrical energy into visible light.

### Overview

- **Type**: Semiconductor diode
- **Invented**: 1962
- **Applications**: Display screens, indicators, lighting, etc.

### Operation

#### 1. **Forward Biasing**

- Applying a voltage across the LED causes electrons to move from the n-type region to the p-type region, where they recombine with holes.
- **n-type region**: Contains extra electrons.
- **p-type region**: Contains extra holes (absence of electrons).

#### 2. **Recombination**

- Electrons in the conduction band fall into holes in the valence band, releasing energy.
- The energy is emitted as a photon, creating light.

#### 3. **Color Emission**

- The color of the emitted light depends on the energy band gap of the semiconductor material.
- Different materials create different colors, e.g., GaAs for infrared, GaP for red, GaN for blue.

### Physics

- **Electroluminescence**: The phenomenon of light emission due to electron-hole recombination.
- **Energy Band Gap**: The energy difference between the conduction and valence bands determines the wavelength (color) of the emitted light.
- **Quantum Efficiency**: The ratio of the number of photons emitted to the number of electrons passing through the LED.

### Materials

- Common materials include Gallium Arsenide (GaAs), Gallium Phosphide (GaP), Gallium Nitride (GaN), and their alloys.

### Types

1. **Inorganic LEDs**: Traditional LEDs, used in various colors.
2. **Organic LEDs (OLEDs)**: Utilize organic materials.
3. **Quantum Dot LEDs (QLEDs)**: Use quantum dots to improve color purity.

### Advantages

- **Energy Efficiency**: Consume less power compared to incandescent bulbs.
- **Longevity**: Typically last up to 25,000 hours or more.
- **Environmental Friendly**: No toxic elements like mercury.

### Challenges

- **Heat Dissipation**: Must be managed to prevent degradation.
- **Cost**: Can be more expensive than traditional lighting solutions.
