# Jahn-Teller Effect

The **Jahn-Teller effect** (also known as Jahn-Teller distortion) is a geometric distortion of molecules and ions that is associated with certain electron configurations. This effect, which describes an instability of molecules, ions, or solids that have a degenerate ground state, results in a lowering of the overall molecular symmetry and energy.

## Overview

The Jahn-Teller theorem, first proposed by Hermann Arthur Jahn and Edward Teller in 1937, states that any non-linear molecule with a spatially degenerate electronic ground state will undergo a geometrical distortion that removes that degeneracy, because the distortion lowers the total electronic energy.

## Implications

The Jahn-Teller effect is most often encountered in octahedral complexes, such as transition metal complexes, where it causes a distortion in the shape of the complex. This can have significant effects on the color, reactivity, and other properties of the complex.

## Examples

One of the most common examples of the Jahn-Teller effect is in the copper(II) complex [CuF6]4-. In this complex, the effect causes a distortion that elongates two of the Cu-F bonds.
