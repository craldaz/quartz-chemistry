Thermochemistry is the branch of chemistry that deals with the study of energy changes that occur during chemical reactions and phase changes . It focuses on the heat energy associated with these processes, such as melting, boiling, and combustion. Thermochemistry involves the measurement and calculation of energy changes, including enthalpy, entropy, and Gibbs free energy. It plays a crucial role in understanding and predicting the behavior of chemical reactions and the stability of compounds.

Thermochemical equations and reactions are used to describe the energy changes associated with a chemical reaction. These equations provide information about the heat absorbed or released during a reaction, as well as the enthalpy change and the amount of heat transferred.

Computational thermochemistry involves the use of computational methods and models to predict and analyze the thermodynamic properties of compounds and reactions. It allows researchers to study and understand the behavior of chemical systems without performing extensive experimental measurements.

Overall, thermochemistry is an important field of study in chemistry that provides insights into the energy changes that occur during chemical reactions , helping to explain and predict the behavior of chemical systems.

## Key Concepts

### System and Surroundings
The system includes the part of the universe under study, and the surroundings include everything else. 

### State and Equilibrium
The state of a system is described by its properties or variables, while equilibrium is a state in which all properties are unchanging in time.

### Thermodynamic Processes
These are changes from one equilibrium state to another. Common types include isothermal (constant temperature), adiabatic (no heat exchange), isochoric (constant volume), and isobaric (constant pressure) processes.

### Heat and Work
Heat is energy transferred due to a temperature difference
