Modeling Excited States

Optimizing excited-state orbitals

Variational Collapse makes it difficult to get excited-state specific orbitals
Optimization often instead leads to a nearby minimum like the ground state

Square gradient minimization

Find some set of orbitals $\theta$ corresponding to a desired non-Aufbau (excited state) electronic configuration such that the energy E(theta) is stationary vs theta without collapsing to another state

All stationary points are global minima of $\Delta=|\nabla_{\theta} E|^2$
Need the gradient of $\Delta$, not much more expensive than doing 

Does really good for x-ray (Orbital Optimized ROKS can get < 0.5 RMS error) excitation energy

## Feedback
Ground-State quantum chemistry slide (too many bullet points)

Kind of strange to note the applications several slides in. Would it be better to introduce this at the beginning?
