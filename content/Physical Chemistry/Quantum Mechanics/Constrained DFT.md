# Constrained Density Functional Theory

Constrained Density Functional Theory (cDFT) is a variant of Density Functional Theory (DFT), a computational quantum mechanical modelling method used in physics, chemistry and materials science to investigate the electronic structure of many-body systems.

## Overview

In cDFT, constraints are added to the standard DFT equations to control certain aspects of the system under study. These constraints can be used to study a wide range of phenomena, including charge transfer, electron affinity, and bond dissociation energies.

## Theory

The central idea behind cDFT is to add an additional term to the standard DFT energy functional that represents a constraint. This constraint is typically represented as a Lagrange multiplier times a function of the electron density. The constraint can be chosen to represent a wide variety of physical phenomena.

## Applications

cDFT has been used to study a wide range of systems and phenomena. Some of the most common applications include:

- **Charge Transfer**: cDFT can be used to calculate the charge transfer between different parts of a molecule or between different molecules in a complex.

- **Electron Affinity**: cDFT can be used to calculate the electron affinity of atoms and molecules, which is the energy change associated with adding an electron to the system.

- **Bond Dissociation Energies**: cDFT can be used to calculate bond dissociation energies, which are the energies required to break a bond in a molecule.
