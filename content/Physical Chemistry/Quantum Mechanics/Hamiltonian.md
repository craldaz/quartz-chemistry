We need to solve one-electron and two electron integrals

Our wavefunction is made of mo, mo are made of primitive orbitals, primatial orbitals are made of basis sets. Something also about Cartesian to spherical transformation.

One Electron Nuclear Attraction Integrals 

By expressing the molecular integrals in terms of Hermite Gaussians (which are products of [[Gaussian Orbitals]] and Hermite polynomials), the Gaussian Overlap Distribution and Gaussian product theorem play a crucial role in simplifying the integrals. The [[McMurchie-Davidson Recurrence Relation]] leverages the Gaussian Overlap Distribution and the properties of Hermite polynomials to efficiently evaluate the overlap, kinetic, and potential energy integrals involving GTOs.

In summary, the Gaussian Overlap Distribution refers to the overlap integral between two Gaussian functions, and its properties are essential in the McMurchie-Davidson Recurrence Relation for simplifying and efficiently computing molecular integrals involving Gaussian Type Orbitals in quantum chemistry calculations.
