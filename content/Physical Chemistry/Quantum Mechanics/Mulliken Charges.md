# `Title:` [[Mulliken Charges]]
--- 

This works well with a small basis set because it calculates the charges assuming the label of the basis set belongs to asingle atom. Makes a connection between basis function and the atom that its centered on. 


In the small basis set it is true that the overlap of the basis functions on an atom with another atom is small, therefore the assumption holds.

HOwever, in large basis sets (or with diffusion) more, and more basis functions overlap with other atoms and it no longer holds that the basis function belongs to a "single atom" and the charge is complete garbage.
