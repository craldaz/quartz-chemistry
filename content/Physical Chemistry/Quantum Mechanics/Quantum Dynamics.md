Refers to solving the time dependent schrodinger equation
$$i\hbar\Psi(r,t) = \hat{H}\Psi(r,t)$$

for the total nuclear and electronic wavefunction as a function of time. 

This can typically be solved in two ways:  

1. Expressing the time-dependent SchroÌˆdinger equation on a grid
2.  Representing nuclear wave packets by a swarm of trajectories â€“ whether they are quantum, classical, coupled, or uncoupled
