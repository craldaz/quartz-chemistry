[[Gaussian Product Theorem]]

Gaussian's are used instead of Slater orbitals because the integrals can be solved more easily

Contracted Gaussian Functions are used and define a basis set

 Exponent and contraction coefficient are shown in the basis set file
 
Cartesian Gaussian form vs spherical Gaussian function
