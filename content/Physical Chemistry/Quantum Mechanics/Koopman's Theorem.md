# Koopman's Theorem

Koopman's theorem is a fundamental principle in the field of quantum mechanics, particularly in the study of many-electron systems. It was proposed by Bernard Koopman in 1931.

## Overview

Koopman's theorem states that the ionization potential of a system is equal to the negative of the orbital energy of the electron removed from the system. Similarly, the electron affinity is equal to the negative of the orbital energy of the added electron. This theorem is based on the assumption that the wave function of the system does not change upon ionization or electron addition.

## Applications

Koopman's theorem is widely used in quantum chemistry to estimate ionization potentials and electron affinities. It is particularly useful in the context of Hartree-Fock theory, where it provides a simple and computationally efficient method for calculating these quantities.

However, it's important to note that Koopman's theorem is an approximation. It neglects electron correlation effects, which can lead to significant deviations from experimental values. More accurate methods, such as configuration interaction or coupled cluster theory, are often needed for precise calculations.
