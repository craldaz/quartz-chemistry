# Gibbs-Helmholtz Equation

## Overview

The Gibbs-Helmholtz equation is a thermodynamic equation derived from the combined first and second laws of thermodynamics. It relates the change in enthalpy (H), the change in entropy (S), and the change in Gibbs free energy (G) of a system at a constant temperature.

## Mathematical Formulation

The Gibbs-Helmholtz equation is given by:

    Î”G = Î”H - TÎ”S

Where:
- Î”G is the change in Gibbs free energy
- Î”H is the change in enthalpy
- T is the absolute temperature
- Î”S is the change in entropy

The equation can also be expressed in terms of the temperature derivative of the Gibbs free energy:

    (d(Î”G/T) / dT)_p = -Î”H / T^2

## Applications

The Gibbs-Helmholtz equation is used in various fields of science and engineering, including chemistry, biochemistry, and materials science. It is particularly useful for predicting the spontaneity of a process at a given temperature. If Î”G is negative, the process is spontaneous; if Î”G is positive, the process is non-spontaneous; and if Î”G is zero, the system is at equilibrium.

## History

The Gibbs-Helmholtz equation is named after Josiah Willard Gibbs and Hermann von Helmholtz, two of the founders of thermodynamics. It is a direct consequence of the definition of the Gibbs free energy, which was introduced by Gibbs in the 19th century as a measure of the maximum reversible work that a system can perform at constant temperature and pressure.
