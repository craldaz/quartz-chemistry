**Fermi's Golden Rule**

Fermi's Golden Rule, named after physicist Enrico Fermi, is a principle that is used in quantum mechanics to determine the transition rates of systems that are initially in a non-equilibrium state. It provides a way to calculate the transition probabilities of quantum mechanical systems perturbed by a weak external force, often used in the context of atomic, molecular, optical, nuclear, and solid state physics.

**Formulation**

Fermi's Golden Rule is typically expressed as:

    W_{fi} = 2œÄ/hbar * |<f|H'|i>|^2 * œÅ(E_f)

Where:

- W_{fi} is the transition rate from the initial state |i> to the final state |f>.
- H' is the perturbation Hamiltonian.
- œÅ(E_f) is the density of states at the energy of the final state E_f.
- The term <f|H'|i> represents the matrix element of the interaction Hamiltonian between the initial and final states.

**Assumptions**

Fermi's Golden Rule assumes that the system is initially in a stationary state, and it is then subjected to a weak, time-dependent perturbation. The perturbation should be switched on at some point in time, but the precise moment when it is switched on should not affect the transition rate. It also assumes the system to be in a quasi-steady state, meaning the transition rate does not change appreciably during the transition process.

**Applications**

Fermi's Golden Rule has been used extensively to compute rates of various quantum mechanical transitions. It is also used in the study of various physical phenomena, such as spontaneous emission in quantum optics, the interaction of light and matter, radiative transitions in astrophysics, and decay rates in nuclear physics.
