# `Title:` [[Elementary Reactions]]

- What led me here: [[Reaction Mechanism]]

There are six main types of elementary steps:
1. Acid-base
2. Bimolecular SN2
3. Coordination
4. Heterolysis
5. Nucleophilic addition
6. Nucleophile elimination


Technically an elementary step is a single step, but for convenience I will consider SN2 an "elementary step" for now.
