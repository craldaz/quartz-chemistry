# Standard Enthalpy of Formation

The standard enthalpy of formation, or standard heat of formation, is a measure of the amount of energy absorbed or released when one mole of a substance is created from its constituent elements, with all substances in their standard states.

## Definition

The standard enthalpy of formation (Î”HfÂ°) is defined as the change in enthalpy during the formation of one mole of the compound from its constituent elements, with all substances in their standard states at a specified temperature (usually 298.15 K or 25 Â°C). 

The 'standard' state refers to the most stable physical state of a substance at 1 bar (or 1 atm) and a specified temperature (usually 298.15 K). For example, for elements, the standard state is usually the form in which the element is most stable at 1 bar and 298.15 K.

## Notation

The standard enthalpy of formation is usually denoted by Î”HfÂ°. The 'Î”' symbol represents change, 'H' stands for enthalpy, 'f' stands for formation, and the superscript 'Â°' denotes standard conditions.

## Calculation

The standard enthalpy of formation can be calculated using Hess's Law, which states that the total enthalpy change for a chemical reaction is independent of the pathway of the reaction and depends only on the initial and final states. 

## Applications

The standard enthalpy of formation is a fundamental quantity in thermochemistry, used to calculate the enthalpy changes in chemical reactions. It is also used in the calculation of the energy content of fuels.
