# Physical Chemistry

Physical Chemistry is a branch of chemistry that combines principles of physics and chemistry to understand the physical properties of molecules, the forces that act upon them, and how they interact and behave. It is the study of how matter behaves on a molecular and atomic level, and how chemical reactions occur.

## Overview

Physical chemistry involves the use of mathematical models and formulas to explain findings from experiments and observations. It is often divided into several sub-disciplines, including thermodynamics, quantum chemistry, and kinetics.

### Thermodynamics

Thermodynamics is the study of energy and its transformations. It involves the principles that govern energy exchange, including heat exchange, between different bodies and the surroundings.

### Quantum Chemistry

Quantum chemistry, also known as quantum mechanics, is the study of how particles at the atomic and subatomic level interact and behave. It involves the application of quantum mechanics to physical models and systems, and explains phenomena such as atomic behavior, chemical bonding, and spectroscopy.

### Kinetics

Chemical kinetics is the study of rates of chemical processes. It involves understanding how different experimental conditions can influence the speed of a chemical reaction.

## Applications

Physical chemistry has a wide range of applications. It is used in the design and synthesis of new chemical substances (including drugs and polymers), in the development of energy production and storage devices (such as batteries and fuel cells), and in environmental science to understand how pollutants spread and how they can be neutralized.
