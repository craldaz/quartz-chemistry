Crooks Fluctuation Theorem is a remarkable result in statistical mechanics that provides a quantitative description of the nature of irreversibility in nonequilibrium thermodynamic processes. This theorem is particularly relevant when studying microscopic or nanoscopic systems where thermal fluctuations become significant.

In essence, the theorem provides a relationship between the probabilities of forward and reverse processes in a system transitioning between two thermodynamic states. Specifically, it gives the difference in work done on the system for the forward and reverse processes in terms of their respective probabilities.

The mathematical statement of Crooks Fluctuation Theorem is as follows:

Pf(W) / Pr(-W) = exp(Î²W - Î²Î”F)

Where:
- Pf(W) is the probability of the forward process doing work W on the system.
- Pr(-W) is the probability of the reverse process doing work -W.
- Î² is the inverse of the product of Boltzmann's constant and the absolute temperature (1/kT).
- Î”F is the difference in free energy between the final and initial states.

Crooks Fluctuation Theorem, along with the Jarzynski Equality, provides a way to connect equilibrium thermodynamic quantities (like free energy changes) to the statistics of nonequilibrium processes. This has found significant applications in areas such as single-molecule biophysics and nanotechnology.
