# Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)

Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) is a distance-dependent physical process by which energy is transferred from an excited molecular fluorophore (the donor) to another fluorophore (the acceptor). 

## Overview

FRET is a powerful and widely used spectroscopic technique. It is non-radiative, meaning the energy transfer occurs through dipole-dipole coupling. The efficiency of FRET is highly dependent on the distance between the donor and acceptor, making it an effective "molecular ruler" for measuring distances within molecules or between molecules in biological systems.

## Principle

The principle of FRET involves the excitation of a donor fluorophore, which then transfers energy to an acceptor fluorophore in a non-radiative fashion through long-range dipole-dipole interactions. This energy transfer can only occur when:

- The emission spectrum of the donor overlaps with the absorption spectrum of the acceptor.
- The donor and acceptor are in close proximity (typically 1-10 nm).
- The transition dipole moments of the donor and acceptor are properly oriented.

## Applications

FRET has a wide range of applications, particularly in the field of biology and biochemistry, including:

- **Protein Interaction Studies**: FRET can be used to study protein-protein interactions by labeling the two proteins of interest with suitable donor and acceptor fluorophores.

- **Cellular Imaging**: FRET is used in cellular imaging to study various biological processes at the molecular level.

- **DNA Analysis**: FRET can be used to study the structure and dynamics of DNA.

- **Biosensors**: FRET-based biosensors are used to detect various biological molecules and monitor biological processes.
