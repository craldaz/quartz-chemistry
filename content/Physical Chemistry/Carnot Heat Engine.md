As for the Carnot engine, it's a theoretical construct and consists of a gas enclosed in a cylinder with a movable piston. The operation of a Carnot engine comprises two isothermal processes and two adiabatic processes:

1. **Isothermal Expansion**: The gas in the cylinder is heated, and it expands, pushing the piston and doing work on the surroundings. The temperature remains constant during this process.

2. **Adiabatic Expansion**: The gas continues to expand without any heat input (i.e., it's thermally insulated). This causes the gas to cool down.

3. **Isothermal Compression**: The gas is compressed, which requires work to be done on the gas. During this compression, heat is released to the surroundings, and the temperature remains constant.

4. **Adiabatic Compression**: Further compression occurs without any heat exchange with the surroundings. The gas temperature increases during this process.

At the end of these four steps, the system is back in its initial state, meaning that the cycle can begin anew. The Carnot engine, although not a practical engine due to its assumptions (like the absence of friction and the infinitely slow isothermal steps), remains significant because it defines the maximum efficiency that any engine can achieve between two temperatures.
