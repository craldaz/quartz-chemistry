# Jarzynski Equality

The **Jarzynski Equality** is a result in statistical mechanics that provides a relationship between the work performed on a system during a non-equilibrium process and the free energy difference between the initial and final states of the system. This equality is a powerful tool as it allows us to relate equilibrium and non-equilibrium thermodynamics.

## Statement

Mathematically, the Jarzynski Equality is given by the following equation:

```
âŸ¨e^(-Î²W)âŸ© = e^(-Î²Î”F)
```

Here, 

- `W` is the work done on the system,
- `Î²` is the inverse temperature (1/kT, where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the absolute temperature),
- `Î”F` is the change in Helmholtz free energy of the system, and
- `âŸ¨...âŸ©` denotes an average over all trajectories in the phase space that start from the same initial condition.

This expression holds even when the system is driven far from equilibrium, which is what makes it remarkable.

## Significance

The Jarzynski Equality is significant as it provides a bridge between equilibrium and non-equilibrium thermodynamics, allowing the computation of equilibrium quantities from non-equilibrium processes. This can be particularly useful in systems where it is difficult to measure changes in free energy directly.

## History

The equality was derived by physicist Christopher Jarzynski in 1997. Since then, it has been applied in numerous areas of physics and beyond, including condensed matter physics, chemical physics, and even the theory of computing.

This is a basic introduction to the topic. The links (denoted by #) are placeholders and should link to the corresponding topics for a complete wiki-style entry. The Jarzynski Equality is a sophisticated topic and this entry might be extended with more specific sections regarding its derivation, proof, applications, experimental verification, etc.

The connection between the Jarzynski equality and the decay processes, particularly with exponential decay, lies in the statistical interpretation of these systems. 

In an exponential decay process, the probability of an event occurring decreases over time according to an exponential function. A classic example of this is radioactive decay, where the number of undecayed atoms decreases exponentially over time. 

The Jarzynski equality is also concerned with probabilities - specifically, the statistical average over all possible trajectories of a system during a non-equilibrium process. This equality becomes particularly important when the system is rare or is driven far from equilibrium, which could be considered analogous to the "tail" of an exponential decay process. 

In other words, the Jarzynski equality can give us information about the behavior of a system in states that are not often observed (like the tail end of an exponential decay), since it relates these non-equilibrium states to the equilibrium free energy difference. This equality can therefore provide insights into rare events in decay processes.

However, this is quite a high-level analogy and it's important to note that the Jarzynski equality and exponential decay processes are distinct concepts that apply to different kinds of systems and scenarios.
