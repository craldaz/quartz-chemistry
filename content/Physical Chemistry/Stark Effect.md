# Stark Effect

The Stark effect is the shifting and splitting of spectral lines of atoms and molecules due to the presence of an external static electric field. It is the electric-field analogue of the Zeeman effect where a spectral line is split into several components due to the presence of a magnetic field.

## Overview

The Stark effect is named after Johannes Stark, who discovered it in 1913. It became an important tool in quantum mechanics, which describes its origin. The amount of splitting or shifting is called the Stark splitting or Stark shift.

## Quantum Mechanical Description

In quantum mechanics, the Stark effect is associated with the energy shift of quantum states due to the external electric field. The Stark effect can be either linear (first-order) or quadratic (second-order), depending on whether the quantum state is degenerate or not.

## Types of Stark Effect

1. **Linear Stark Effect**: Observed in hydrogen spectral lines, where the levels are four-fold degenerate. The degeneracy causes the energy shift to be proportional to the electric field.

2. **Quadratic Stark Effect**: Observed in helium spectral lines, where the levels are not degenerate. The energy shift is proportional to the square of the electric field.

## Applications

The Stark effect has been used to:

- Measure electric fields in plasmas.
- Determine the dipole moment of molecules in gases.
- Study the levels of atoms and molecules.
- Test the validity of quantum mechanics.
