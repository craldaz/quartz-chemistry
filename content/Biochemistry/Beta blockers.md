## Beta Blockers

**Beta blockers**, also known as beta-adrenergic blocking agents, are a class of drugs primarily used to manage abnormal heart rhythms, and to protect the heart from a second heart attack (myocardial infarction) after a first one has occurred. They are also widely used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension), anxiety, migraines, and certain forms of tremors.

Beta blockers work by blocking the effects of epinephrine (adrenaline), a hormone that stimulates the heart to beat faster and more forcefully. By doing so, they reduce heart rate, decrease blood pressure, and help to lower energy expenditure, thereby reducing the heart's demand for oxygen.

There are two main types of beta-adrenergic receptors in the heart, known as beta-1 and beta-2 receptors. Some beta blockers are selective and primarily block the beta-1 receptors (these are known as cardioselective beta blockers), which are predominantly found in the heart and kidneys. Nonselective beta blockers block both beta-1 and beta-2 receptors.

Commonly prescribed beta blockers include atenolol (Tenormin), bisoprolol (Zebeta), metoprolol (Lopressor, Toprol XL), propranolol (Inderal, InnoPran XL), and carvedilol (Coreg). Side effects can include fatigue, cold hands, headache, upset stomach, and constipation.
