### G Protein-Coupled Receptor (GPCR)

**G Protein-Coupled Receptors (GPCRs)**, also known as seven-transmembrane domain receptors, 7TM receptors, heptahelical receptors, serpentine receptors, and G protein-linked receptors (GPLRs), are a broad class of proteins that play a key role in signal transduction.

#### Overview

GPCRs are membrane proteins that detect molecules outside the cell and activate internal response pathways. They are involved in a wide variety of physiological processes.

#### Structure

- **Transmembrane Helices**: Seven transmembrane alpha-helices form the core structure.
- **Extracellular Domains**: Bind to signaling molecules (ligands).
- **Intracellular Domains**: Interact with G proteins and other intracellular signaling molecules.

#### Function

1. **Ligand Binding**: GPCRs detect signaling molecules such as hormones, neurotransmitters, and sensory stimuli.
2. **Signal Transduction**: Upon ligand binding, GPCRs activate G proteins, triggering a signaling cascade within the cell.
3. **Regulatory Mechanisms**: GPCRs are regulated through processes such as phosphorylation and desensitization.

#### Types

1. **Class A (Rhodopsin-like)**: Largest class, includes receptors for hormones and neurotransmitters.
2. **Class B (Secretin-like)**: Recognize peptides and have long N-terminus.
3. **Class C (Metabotropic Glutamate)**: Involved in neurotransmission, contain large extracellular ligand-binding domains.
4. **Others**: Additional classes based on specific characteristics and functions.

#### Clinical Significance

- **Therapeutic Targets**: Many drugs target GPCRs, including treatments for asthma, hypertension, and mental disorders.
- **Disease Association**: Mutations in GPCRs are linked to various diseases, such as retinitis pigmentosa and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.

#### Research Tools

- **Agonists**: Compounds that activate the receptor.
- **Antagonists**: Compounds that block the receptor.
- **Biophysical Techniques**: Such as crystallography and cryo-EM, used to study structure.
