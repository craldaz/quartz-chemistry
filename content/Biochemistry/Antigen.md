## Antigens

An **antigen** is a molecule capable of inducing an immune response (to produce an antibody) in the host organism. These molecules can be substances from the environment like pollen or chemicals, as well as compounds found on the surfaces of pathogens such as viruses, bacteria, and fungi.

Antigens are classified into two categories based on their source: 

1. **Exogenous antigens**: These antigens enter the body from the outside, for example, by inhalation, ingestion, or injection.

2. **Endogenous antigens**: These are generated within normal cells due to normal cell metabolism, or because of viral or intracellular bacterial infection.

Antigens can further be classified into two types: 

1. **T-Independent antigens**: These antigens stimulate the B cells directly to produce antibodies.

2. **T-Dependent antigens**: These antigens first bind to the T cells, and then the T cells stimulate the B cells to produce antibodies.

Antigens play a crucial role in the immune system's defense mechanism. The interaction of antigens with the specific antibodies or specific immune cells leads to an immune response, aiming to destroy the pathogens or foreign substances. This process is at the heart of many vaccinations, where a harmless antigen is introduced to help the immune system recognize and combat harmful pathogens in the future.
