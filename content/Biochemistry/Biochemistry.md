# Biochemistry
Biochemistry is the branch of science that explores the chemical processes within and related to
living organisms. It is a laboratory-based science that combines biology and chemistry. By using
chemical knowledge and techniques, biochemists can help to understand and solve biological problems
## Overview
Biochemistry has become the foundation for understanding all biological processes. It has provided
explanations for the causes of many diseases in humans, animals and plants. It can frequently
suggest ways by which such diseases may be treated or cured.

 ## History
The term "biochemistry" itself is derived from a combination of biology and chemistry. In 1877,
Felix Hoppe-Seyler used the term (biochemie in German) as a synonym for physiological chemistry in
the foreword to the first issue of Zeitschrift fÃ¼r Physiologische Chemie (Journal of Physiological
Chemistry) where he argued for the setting up of institutes dedicated to this field of study.

## Branches of Biochemistry
Biochemistry can be divided into three fields; molecular genetics, protein science and metabolism.
Each of these is a separate field but all are interconnected.
1. **Molecular Genetics** - It is the study of the biochemical processes involved in the cellular
replication of genes.

2. **Protein Science** - It involves the study of the structure and function of proteins.
3. **Metabolism** - It includes the study of the chemical reactions in cells and organisms that
support life.
## Applications
Biochemistry has wide applications in medicine, dentistry, and veterinary medicine. In food
science, biochemists determine the chemical composition of foods, research ways to develop abundant
and inexpensive sources of nutritious foods, develop methods to extract nutrients from waste
products, and/or invent ways to prolong the shelf life of food products. In agriculture,
biochemists investigate the interaction between herbicides with plants.
