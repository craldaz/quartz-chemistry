# Amino Acids

Amino acids are organic compounds that combine to form proteins. They are fundamental building blocks of life and are crucial for numerous functions in organisms.

## Overview

Amino acids are composed of an amino group (-NH2), a carboxyl group (-COOH), and a side chain (R group) that varies between different amino acids. The key elements of an amino acid are carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen.

## Classification

There are 20 standard amino acids that make up proteins in organisms. They can be classified into several categories:

- **Essential Amino Acids**: These cannot be synthesized by the body and must be obtained from the diet. In humans, there are nine essential amino acids: histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, and valine.

- **Nonessential Amino Acids**: These can be synthesized by the body. They include alanine, asparagine, aspartic acid, and glutamic acid.

- **Conditional Amino Acids**: These are usually not essential, except in times of illness and stress. They include arginine, cysteine, glutamine, tyrosine, glycine, ornithine, proline, and serine.

## Functions

Amino acids play several roles in the body:

- **Protein Synthesis**: Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins, which are necessary for the growth, repair, and maintenance of body tissues.

- **Energy Source**: Some amino acids can be used as a source of energy by the body.

- **Neurotransmitter Regulation**: Amino acids such as glutamate and glycine can function as neurotransmitters in the brain. Others, like tryptophan and tyrosine, are precursors to neurotransmitters.

- **Immune Function**: Certain amino acids like arginine and glutamine are crucial for immune function.
