### Protein Folding

**Protein folding** is the physical process by which a protein chain acquires its native three-dimensional structure, a shape that is usually biologically functional. It is a vital process in biology, and its failure to occur correctly can lead to various diseases.

#### Process

Proteins are made up of amino acids, and the sequence of these amino acids dictates the structure of the protein. Protein folding is driven by the minimization of the free energy of the system. The correct three-dimensional structure is essential for the protein's function.

1. **Primary Structure**: The linear sequence of amino acids.
2. **Secondary Structure**: The formation of alpha-helices and beta-sheets.
3. **Tertiary Structure**: The overall folding of the single polypeptide chain.
4. **Quaternary Structure**: The assembly of multiple polypeptide chains.

#### Levinthal's Paradox

[Levinthal's paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levinthal%27s_paradox) is a thought experiment that demonstrates the complexity of protein folding. It shows that it is computationally infeasible for a protein to fold by randomly trying every conformation until the lowest energy structure is found.

#### Diseases

Protein misfolding can lead to various diseases, such as:

- [Alzheimer's Disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer%27s_disease)
- [Parkinson's Disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_disease)
- [Huntington's Disease](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huntington%27s_disease)

#### Techniques for Studying

Several methods are used to study protein folding, including:

- **X-ray Crystallography**
- **NMR Spectroscopy**
- **Cryo-Electron Microscopy**

#### Computational Prediction

Computational prediction of protein folding has become a significant area of research, with tools like [AlphaFold](https://deepmind.com/research/open-source/computational-predictions-of-protein-structures-associated-with-COVID-19) leading the way in accuracy and efficiency.
