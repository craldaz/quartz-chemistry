# Lysergic Acid Diethylamide (LSD)

Lysergic Acid Diethylamide (LSD), also known as acid, is a potent hallucinogenic drug. It is well-known for its psychological effects, which can include altered thoughts, feelings, and awareness of one's surroundings.

## Overview

LSD was first synthesized in 1938 by Swiss chemist Albert Hofmann in the Sandoz Laboratories in Basel, Switzerland. It was not until 1943 that Hofmann discovered the drug's hallucinogenic properties. LSD is derived from ergot, a fungus that grows on rye and other grains.

## Effects and Usage

LSD is used mainly as a recreational drug or for spiritual reasons. It is typically ingested orally, often on a small piece of paper or in a sugar cube, and its effects can last up to 12 hours. Users often experience visual hallucinations and an altered sense of time. LSD can also cause rapid emotional swings and, in some cases, panic attacks or feelings of paranoia.

## Mechanism of Action

LSD acts primarily by binding to serotonin receptors in the brain, particularly the 5-HT2A receptor. This receptor is involved in the regulation of mood, cognition, and perception. LSD's effects on this receptor lead to its characteristic hallucinogenic effects.

## Legality and Research

LSD is classified as a Schedule I drug under the Controlled Substances Act in the United States, meaning it has a high potential for abuse, no currently accepted medical use in treatment, and a lack of accepted safety for use under medical supervision.

However, recent years have seen a resurgence in research into the potential therapeutic uses of LSD, including for the treatment of depression, anxiety, and addiction. Preliminary results have been promising, but more research is needed.
