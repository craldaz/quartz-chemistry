## Monoclonal Antibodies
Biologic 
A **monoclonal antibody (mAb)** is a type of protein made in the laboratory that can bind to substances in the body, including cancer cells. Monoclonal antibodies are identical copies of one type of immune cell, known as a B cell, and are designed to engage with a single specific antigen.

Monoclonal antibodies are produced using hybridoma technology, which involves the fusion of an immune cell with a cancer cell. The resultant 'hybrid' cell is both immortal and produces the desired antibody. These cells are then cultured and the antibodies harvested.

Monoclonal antibodies have a wide range of applications in both the medical and research fields. 

In medicine, they can be used in:
1. **Cancer treatment**: Monoclonal antibodies can be designed to bind to unique or overexpressed proteins on cancer cells. Some are used to deliver cytotoxic agents directly to cancer cells, while others are used to modulate the immune response to enhance the body's ability to fight cancer.

2. **Autoimmune diseases**: Monoclonal antibodies can be used to block inflammatory signals in autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease.

3. **Infectious diseases**: In the treatment of infectious diseases, monoclonal antibodies can be used to neutralize pathogens or their toxins.

In research, monoclonal antibodies are commonly used in techniques such as:
1. **Flow cytometry**: This technique is used to analyze the characteristics of cells, such as their size, granularity, and the presence of certain markers on their surface.
2. **ELISA (Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay)**: A common laboratory technique which uses antibodies to detect the presence of antigens in a sample.
3. **Western blot**: A technique used to detect specific proteins in a sample.
