## Surfactants

Surfactants, or surface active agents, are compounds that lower the surface tension (or interfacial tension) between two liquids, between a gas and a liquid, or between a liquid and a solid.

### Overview

Surfactants may act as detergents, wetting agents, emulsifiers, foaming agents, and dispersants. They are used in a variety of applications, from household cleaning products to industrial processes. 

### Structure and Properties

Surfactants are usually organic compounds that are amphiphilic, meaning they contain both hydrophobic groups (their tails) and hydrophilic groups (their heads). This dual nature allows them to interact with both water and oil, making them useful in processes like emulsification and foaming.

### Applications

Surfactants are key ingredients in many cleaning and personal care products, including soaps, shampoos, and detergents. They are also used in food, in paints, in fuels, as emulsifiers, as anti-foaming agents, and in pharmaceuticals.

### Chemistry

Surfactants belong to the field of [Physical Chemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_chemistry) and [Organic Chemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_chemistry). They are studied in the subfield of [Colloid and Surface Chemistry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colloid_and_interface_science), which deals with phenomena related to materials of a discontinuous nature.
